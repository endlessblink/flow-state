# Palette's Journal 🎨\n\n## 2025-02-23 - BaseCard Interactive Accessibility\n**Learning:** The `BaseCard` component is often used as an interactive element (with `hoverable` prop) but lacked proper semantics. It was just a `div` with a click handler, making it inaccessible to keyboard and screen reader users.\n**Action:** When creating generic container components that can be interactive, always conditionally apply `role="button"`, `tabindex="0"`, and keyboard handlers (Enter/Space) to ensure they function as buttons for all users. Also ensure distinct focus styles (e.g., `:focus-visible`) are present.
