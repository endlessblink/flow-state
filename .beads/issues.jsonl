{"id":"flow-state-ulh","title":"Tauri: Improve migration command to detect local vs remote Supabase","description":"**Problem:** The Tauri startup runs `supabase db push` which fails without a linked remote project. Quick fix applied: added `--local` flag.\n\n**Proper solution needed:**\n1. Detect whether running against local or remote Supabase\n2. Use `--local` flag only for local dev\n3. Consider if migrations should even run on app startup (vs. during build/deploy)\n4. Handle errors gracefully - don't block app startup for migration failures\n\n**Files:** src-tauri/src/lib.rs:182-202, src/composables/useTauriStartup.ts","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"endlessblink@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-20T17:05:13.985924184+02:00","created_by":"endlessblink","updated_at":"2026-01-20T17:06:11.933706042+02:00","closed_at":"2026-01-20T17:06:11.933706042+02:00","close_reason":"Implemented auto-detection: checks for .supabase/project-ref to determine local vs remote.
