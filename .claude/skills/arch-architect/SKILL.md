# Architect Master Skill

## 🎯 **Capabilities**
- **Planning**: creating and updating `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`.
- **Refactoring**: Organizing folder structure, decoupling logic.
- **Analysis**: Reviewing code for patterns and anti-patterns.
- **Design**: Defining component hierarchy and data flow.

## 🏛️ **Architecture Principles**
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI vs Logic (Composables) vs State (Pinia).
- **Single Source of Truth**: Data lives in the Store or Database, not scattered refs.
- **Type Safety**: strict TypeScript everywhere.

## 📜 **Protocol**
1.  **Analyze**: Look at the big picture before changing lines.
2.  **Plan**: Write an Implementation Plan artifact.
3.  **Approve**: Get user buy-in on the plan.
4.  **Execute**: Guide the coding process.
