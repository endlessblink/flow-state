# AI Behavior Rules

## Project Management & Dev Manager
This project uses a custom Dev Manager (Kanban) that parses `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`.
When you complete a task:
1.  **Mark as DONE**: You MUST mark the task as done in `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`.
2.  **Update ALL References**: A task might appear in multiple places:
    *   The "Active Work" table
    *   The "Planned" or "Roadmap" sections
    *   **CRITICAL**: The main task header definition (e.g., `### TASK-XXX: Title (PLANNED)` -> `### ~~TASK-XXX~~: Title (✅ DONE)`)
3.  **Strict Formatting**: Use `~~TASK-XXX~~` strikethrough and `(✅ DONE)` status to ensure the parser detects it correctly.

## Component Organization
*   Components are organized by domain in `src/components/` (sync, tasks, projects, layout, common, inbox, debug).
*   New components should be placed in the appropriate subdirectory.
*   Always use absolute imports (`@/components/...`) instead of relative imports.
