error during build:
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "dompurify" from "/home/endlessblink/my-projects/ai-development/productivity/pomo-flow/src/utils/security.ts".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
`build.rollupOptions.external`
