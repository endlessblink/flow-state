## Active Bugs (P0-P1)

### ~~BUG-1105~~: JWT Signature Mismatch - All Supabase Requests Return 401 (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-29)

**Problem**: Production Supabase JWT keys mismatched after VPS JWT_SECRET configuration.

**Root Cause**:
1. VPS Supabase had JWT_SECRET but ANON_KEY/SERVICE_ROLE_KEY were signed with demo secret
2. Production build had outdated keys after regeneration

**Fix Applied**:
1. Generated new JWT keys signed with VPS JWT_SECRET (see SOP-036)
2. Updated VPS `/opt/supabase/docker/.env` with new keys
3. Updated Doppler secrets
4. Redeployed production: `doppler run -- npm run build && rsync dist/ VPS`

**SOP Created**: `docs/sop/SOP-036-supabase-jwt-key-regeneration.md`

### ~~BUG-1106~~: Realtime Sync Not Initializing After Sign-In via Modal (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-29)

**Problem**: Canvas realtime sync between localhost and VPS stopped working. Tasks/groups created on one device didn't appear on others.

**Root Causes**:
1. VPS Caddyfile missing WebSocket upgrade headers for Supabase Realtime
2. `initRealtimeSubscription` only called in `onMounted`, not re-initialized when user signs in via modal after loading as guest

**Fix Applied**:
1. Added WebSocket headers to VPS `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`:
   ```
   header_up Connection {header.Connection}
   header_up Upgrade {header.Upgrade}
   ```
2. Added `watch` on `authStore.isAuthenticated` in `useAppInitialization.ts` to re-initialize realtime when user signs in after initial page load

**Files**: `src/composables/app/useAppInitialization.ts`, VPS `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`

### ~~TASK-1009~~: Unified Timer Completion Notifications (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-29)

**Enhancement**: Timer completion notifications with actionable buttons across all platforms.

**Implementation**:
1. **Web App**: Service Worker notifications with "Start Break" / "+5 min" action buttons (`src/sw.ts`, `src/stores/timer.ts`)
2. **KDE Widget**: notify-send notifications + full-screen overlay with action buttons (`main.qml`)
3. **Deduplication**: Tag-based notification deduplication prevents duplicate alerts
4. **Auto-start removed**: User must explicitly choose next action via notification buttons

**Additional Fixes**:
- Fixed KDE widget auth by correcting Supabase anon key mismatch in plasma config
- Added Tab/Enter key navigation to KDE widget login form

**SOP Created**: `docs/sop/SOP-038-kde-widget-supabase-config.md`

**Files**: `src/sw.ts`, `src/stores/timer.ts`, `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.pomoflow.widget/contents/ui/main.qml`

### ~~BUG-1095~~: Calendar Current Time Indicator Not Showing (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-29)

**Problem**: Red horizontal line showing current time position on calendar was invisible because CSS color variables were referenced but never defined.

**Root Cause**: `--color-danger: hsl(var(--red-500))` referenced `--red-500` which was never defined in `design-tokens.css`.

**Solution**:
1. Added missing color palette variables (`--red-500`, `--green-500`, `--blue-500`) to design-tokens.css
2. Fixed invalid CSS syntax: `margin-left: -var()` → `margin-left: calc(-1 * var())`
3. Made indicator less aggressive: lower z-index (behind tasks), reduced opacity, smaller dot

**Files**: `src/assets/design-tokens.css`, `src/components/calendar/CalendarDayView.vue`

**SOP**: `docs/sop/SOP-040-calendar-time-indicator.md`

### ~~BUG-1211~~: Tasks Disappearing Across Platforms (PWA/Tauri/Web) (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-07)

**Problem**: Tasks may still be disappearing across platforms — PWA on mobile, Tauri desktop app, and web. A task created or edited on one platform can vanish when synced to another. This is the highest severity data loss bug possible.

**5-Agent Investigation (2026-02-06)** — 5 Opus agents investigated independent hypotheses and debated findings:

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND: `_soft_deleted` Column Mismatch Kill Chain**

`useSyncOrchestrator.ts:329` writes `{ _soft_deleted: true }` but DB column is `is_deleted`. The sync orchestrator bypasses `supabaseMappers.ts`, so the update ALWAYS fails. Fallback at line 335 escalates to a HARD DELETE (`supabase.from(tableName).delete()`). This fires on 100% of task deletions:

1. User deletes task → direct path soft-deletes correctly (`is_deleted: true`) ✅
2. 0-5s later → sync queue tries `_soft_deleted: true` → **FAILS** (column doesn't exist)
3. Fallback → `DELETE FROM tasks WHERE id = X` → **HARD DELETE** (permanent)
4. DB trigger `trg_task_tombstone` → permanent tombstone created
5. Realtime broadcasts DELETE event to ALL connected devices
6. All devices blindly splice task from local state (`tasks.ts:205-208`)
7. Any pending updates on other devices silently discarded as "not found" (`useSyncOrchestrator.ts:277-284`)

**Secondary Bugs Found (6 total, ranked by severity):**

| Rank | Bug | Severity | File:Line | Fix |
|------|-----|----------|-----------|-----|
| **1** | `_soft_deleted` → `is_deleted` column mismatch | **CRITICAL** | `useSyncOrchestrator.ts:329` | Change to `{ is_deleted: true, deleted_at: new Date().toISOString() }` |
| **2** | Hard-delete fallback should not exist | **CRITICAL** | `useSyncOrchestrator.ts:335` | Remove fallback or add logging/alerting |
| **3** | LWW "server wins" drops local changes silently | HIGH | `useSyncOrchestrator.ts:309-318` | Apply `serverData` to local state |
| **4** | CREATE upsert overwrites newer server data | HIGH | `useSyncOrchestrator.ts:237-242` | Add timestamp comparison before upsert |
| **5** | Entity "not found" discards queued updates silently | HIGH | `useSyncOrchestrator.ts:277-284` | Log warning, don't mark as `success: true` |
| **6** | No `addPendingWrite` for delete operations | MEDIUM | `taskOperations.ts:474` | Add `addPendingWrite(taskId)` before delete |

**Disproved Hypotheses:**
- ~~Tombstones cause false-positive deletions~~ → Tombstones are passive/defensive only (checked during restore/import, never during sync)
- ~~Store init race conditions~~ → Fixed by BUG-1207 (auth await, reentrancy guard, `appInitLoadComplete` flag)
- ~~Smart merge drops local tasks~~ → TASK-1177 fix preserves ALL local-only tasks (never drops them)
- ~~PiniaSharedState overwrites~~ → Globally disabled at `main.ts:106-111`

**Zombie Resurrection Risk:** Smart merge preserves local-only tasks and re-queues CREATE via sync orchestrator. However, the DB tombstone (created by `trg_task_tombstone` trigger during the hard delete) may block re-creation depending on whether the upsert path checks tombstones (it does NOT — raw `upsert` bypasses `safeCreateTask`). Debate conclusion: 1-2 resurrection cycles possible before realtime DELETE propagates to all devices, then tombstone causes permanent ID poisoning. Not an infinite loop but makes deleted task IDs permanently unusable.

**Debate Consensus (5/5 agents agree):**
1. `_soft_deleted` kill chain is the **#1 confirmed cause** — deterministic, 100% blast radius, cross-platform
2. Zombie resurrection is **real but self-dampening** (1-2 cycles, not infinite)
3. Cross-tab create path (`useCrossTabSync.ts:84`) — H3 found `broadcastTaskOperation` is **dead code** (never called from outside the file), downgrading this from MEDIUM to NOT A VECTOR
4. Two BUG-1211 sub-scenarios identified: (a) intentionally deleted tasks become unrecoverable (primary), (b) tasks disappearing without user action requires additional trigger (LWW silent discard or recovery reload)

**Residual Risks (lower priority):**
- `isVeryRecent` window (30s) misaligned with recovery cooldown (60s) (`taskPersistence.ts:284`)
- Auth SIGNED_IN handler has no interaction cooldown (`auth.ts:316-320`)
- `deleteTask()` missing `addPendingWrite` causes echo processing (`taskOperations.ts:474`)

**Investigation Areas** (original, now resolved):
1. ~~Sync orchestrator~~ → **ROOT CAUSE** (`_soft_deleted` mismatch + 5 secondary bugs)
2. ~~Tombstones~~ → **DISPROVED** (passive/defensive only, but amplified by kill chain)
3. ~~Realtime subscriptions~~ → **CONFIRMED** as propagation mechanism (DELETE handler has zero validation)
4. ~~Store initialization~~ → **DISPROVED** (fixed by BUG-1207)
5. ~~Cross-platform sync~~ → **DISPROVED** (smart merge safe, cross-tab sync is dead code)
6. ~~BUG-1207~~ ✅ regression — task changes resetting in Tauri app (FIXED 2026-02-06)

### ~~BUG-1289~~: Tauri App Crashes on Startup — Notification Plugin Panic (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-10)

**Problem**: Tauri desktop app crashes seconds after opening with: `Cannot start a runtime from within a runtime` in `tauri_plugin_notification::Notification::show`.

**Root Cause**: `tauri-plugin-notification` v2.3.3 on Linux calls `block_on()` inside the tokio runtime when showing a notification. `useTimeBlockNotifications.ts` calls `tick()` immediately on startup, which triggers `deliverNotification()` → Tauri `sendNotification()` → Rust panic.

**Fix**: Disabled `tauri-plugin-notification` entirely. All notification calls now use the Browser `Notification` API which works in Tauri webviews without going through Rust.
- `src/utils/notificationDelivery.ts` — removed Tauri plugin tier, use Browser API only
- `src/stores/timer.ts` — replaced Tauri `sendNotification` with Browser `Notification`
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` — commented out `tauri_plugin_notification::init()`
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` — commented out `tauri-plugin-notification` dependency

**Deployed**: v1.2.39 via `deploy-tauri-update.sh`

### BUG-1290: Week View Not Loading (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-09)

**Problem**: Calendar week view doesn't render at all. Switching to week mode shows blank content.

**Root Cause**: `CalendarWeekView.vue` injects `getWeekEventStyle` and `isCurrentWeekTimeCell` from `calendar-helpers`, but `CalendarView.vue` never provides them. Both functions are `undefined`, crashing the week view template when `:style="getWeekEventStyle(event)"` is called.

**Fix**: Added `getWeekEventStyle` and `isCurrentWeekTimeCell` to the `provide('calendar-helpers')` object in `CalendarView.vue` and destructured them from `weekView` composable.

**Files**: `src/views/CalendarView.vue`

**Progress (2026-02-10):** Root cause identified and fixed — added missing `getWeekEventStyle` and `isCurrentWeekTimeCell` to `provide('calendar-helpers')`. Type-check passes. Awaiting user verification.

---

### BUG-1197: Canvas Group Drag Moves Unrelated Tasks (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-05)

**Problem**: Dragging a group (e.g., "Wednesday") on the canvas also drags tasks that don't belong to that group.

**Root Cause**: Tasks can have stale `parentId` pointing to a group they're no longer spatially inside. `syncStoreToCanvas` blindly sets Vue Flow `parentNode` from `task.parentId` without spatial validation. When the group is dragged, Vue Flow includes all nodes with matching `parentNode` — including stale children — moving them to wrong positions.

**Fix (Two-Part)**:
1. **Sync spatial validation** (`useCanvasSync.ts`): Before setting `parentNode`, validate task's center is actually inside claimed parent group. If outside, treat as root node.
2. **Drag stale detection** (`useCanvasInteractions.ts`): In `onNodeDragStop`, detect when `node.parentNode` doesn't match `task.parentId`. Restore correct position and skip processing.

**Files**: `src/composables/canvas/useCanvasSync.ts`, `src/composables/canvas/useCanvasInteractions.ts`

### TASK-1287: Play Button Should Switch Timer Task Without Resetting (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-10)

**Problem**: Clicking the play button on a different task resets the Pomodoro timer to full duration instead of just switching the associated task. Expected: if 15 min remain on Task A and user clicks play on Task B, the timer should continue at 15 min but now be associated with Task B.

**Root Cause**: `startTimer()` in `timer.ts` unconditionally calls `clearExistingSession()` and creates a brand new session with full duration.

**Fix**: Add `switchTimerTask()` method that changes the task association on the running session without resetting the countdown. `startTimer()` now detects an active work session and calls `switchTimerTask()` instead of resetting.

**Progress (2026-02-10):** Implemented `switchTimerTask()` in `timer.ts`. Added early return in `startTimer()` — when a work timer is active and a different task is requested, it switches the taskId, broadcasts to other devices, and persists to DB without resetting the countdown. Exposed `switchTimerTask` in store return. Needs user testing.

### TASK-1289: Investigate severe task position drift episode (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-09)

**Problem**: User experienced a moment of severe task position drift. Root cause unknown — may be a regression of BUG-1209 fixes or a new drift vector. Needs investigation of recent changes to canvas sync, drag handlers, and position persistence.

**Related**: BUG-1203, BUG-1209, BUG-1061

---

### BUG-1203: Canvas Position Drift in Tauri Desktop App (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: Task positions drift/shift on the canvas in the Tauri desktop app. Positions change unexpectedly, causing tasks to end up in wrong locations.

**Investigation**: TBD - checking canvas sync, drag handlers, and geometry invariant violations.

### BUG-1218: RTL Missing in Calendar Task Create Dialog and Timer Task Name (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-07)

**Problem**: The Calendar-specific QuickTaskCreate dialog and the header timer task name don't support RTL/Hebrew text, while the rest of the app does. Hebrew text in the calendar task title input shows LTR cursor position. Timer task name in the header bar doesn't auto-detect Hebrew direction.

**Fix**:
1. Add `useHebrewAlignment` to `QuickTaskCreate.vue` (Calendar variant) — matches `QuickTaskCreateModal.vue`
2. Fix `.timer-task` CSS in `AppHeader.vue` — use `unicode-bidi: plaintext` unconditionally instead of `:dir(rtl)` selector that never matches in LTR documents

### TASK-1219: Quick Sort Mobile UX Fixes (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW (2026-02-08)

**Problem**: Multiple UX issues on the mobile Quick Sort view:

1. **DUE buttons text-only** — Date buttons (Today, Tmrw, +3d, Wknd) should show emojis + text for faster recognition
2. **Right side cutoff** — Date pills row gets clipped on narrow screens; rightmost buttons partially hidden
3. **Touch target overlap** — Pressing "Tomorrow" also triggers "Wknd" due to cramped touch targets on mobile

**Changes**:
- Added emoji prefixes to all 6 date buttons in both `MobileQuickSortView.vue` and `QuickSortCard.vue`
- Increased pill gap, added scroll padding + scroll-snap for date pills
- Added min-height 40px for proper mobile touch targets
- Fixed `isWeekend` mutual exclusivity (no longer highlights when Tomorrow is active)

**Files**: `src/mobile/views/MobileQuickSortView.vue`, `src/components/QuickSortCard.vue`

### TASK-1220: Quick Sort Pull-Down Capture Panel (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW (2026-02-08)

**Goal**: When user drags the screen down in any mobile view, reveal a command center panel with:
- Search existing tasks
- Create a new task (spacious input with keyboard)
- Record a task with audio (voice-to-text via Whisper)
- Quick action tiles: Quick Sort, Timer, Today, Settings

**Changes**: Implemented as pull-down gesture in `MobileLayout.vue` (available from ALL mobile views, not just Quick Sort). Panel includes task input, voice recording, search with results, and 4 action tiles.

**Files**: `src/mobile/layouts/MobileLayout.vue`

---

### TASK-1221: Quick Sort AI Commands Interface (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P3-LOW | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED

**Goal**: Future concept — AI command interface in Quick Sort pull-down panel. Users can give natural language commands like "show all tasks that are overdue" or "create 3 tasks for project X". Builds on TASK-1220 pull-down panel.

**Blocked By**: TASK-1220

### ~~TASK-1223~~: AI Chat Model Selection UX Redesign (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-09)

**Problem**: AI provider/model selection dropdown is confusing and shows incorrect state:
1. Red health dots are misleading — red on OR/Local looks like "broken/offline" even when just unchecked
2. "OR" label is cryptic — should say "OpenRouter"
3. Header badge only shows provider name — never shows the actual model
4. Model not reset when switching providers
5. No per-provider model memory

**Key Files**: `AIChatPanel.vue`, `useAIChat.ts`, `aiChat.ts` store, `router.ts`

---

### ~~TASK-1222~~: Canvas Overdue Task Collector (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-09)

**Goal**: Right-click context menu option on canvas groups to collect ALL overdue tasks and arrange them in an orderly grid to the left of the group. Tasks inside the group are pulled out. Also exposed via AI chat tool.

**Implementation**:
- `collectOverdueTasksNearGroup` in `useCanvasTaskActions.ts`
- Collects ALL overdue tasks (including those inside target group), detaches them (parentId: null), arranges in grid left of group
- Collision detection shifts grid left if existing tasks occupy the target area
- fitView pans viewport to show results
- AI chat tool `collect_overdue_to_group` triggers via CustomEvent
- Context menu wired through CanvasContextMenu → CanvasContextMenus → CanvasView

### ~~BUG-1216~~: Canvas Mouse Drift + Performance on Tauri (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW (2026-02-07)

**Problem**: Canvas drag drift, sluggish pan/zoom, and typing lag on Tauri desktop app.

**Root Causes Found & Fixed**:
1. **Cursor drift**: CSS `transform: scale()` on drag/hover overriding Vue Flow's `transform: translate()` — removed 3 conflicting scale transforms
2. **Drag sluggishness**: `transition: all` and orphaned `transition: transform` on nodes — replaced with explicit property transitions
3. **Pan/zoom lag**: `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` on TaskNode/GroupNode, edge `transition: all`, production console.logs in hot paths — removed/fixed/dev-gated
4. **Zoom "double take"**: `onMoveEnd` on every scroll-wheel tick writing to reactive Pinia store — debounced 150ms
5. **Pan sluggishness**: `only-render-visible-elements` mount/unmount during pan — removed
6. **Typing lag**: `will-change: transform` on viewport, `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility`, `contain: layout paint` — reverted/simplified

---

### BUG-1212: Sync Queue CREATE Retry Causes "Duplicate Key" Corruption (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: When a task CREATE operation fails in the offline sync queue (network issue, timeout), retries attempt `.insert()` again. If the original insert actually succeeded server-side before the client detected the error, the retry hits `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "tasks_pkey"`. The operation gets stuck as "corrupted" in the sync queue — cannot retry, cannot auto-resolve.

**Root Cause**: `useSyncOrchestrator.ts` line ~238 uses raw `.insert()` for CREATE operations with no conflict handling. Retries blindly re-insert instead of using `.upsert()`.

**Fix (3 layers)**:
1. **Make CREATE idempotent** — Change `.insert()` to `.upsert({ onConflict: 'id' })` in `executeOperation()`
2. **Pre-retry existence check** — Before retrying a CREATE, query if entity already exists → mark completed if so
3. **Smarter error classification** — Treat duplicate key errors on CREATE as "conflict-resolved" (success) not "permanent failure"

**Files**: `src/composables/sync/useSyncOrchestrator.ts`, `src/services/offline/retryStrategy.ts`

### BUG-1286: PWA Today View Shows 2:00 AM on All Tasks Due to UTC Timezone Parsing (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-08)

**Problem**: Tasks in the Mobile Today View all showed "2:00 AM" even though the user never set any due time. Additionally, the time-based grouping broke — all untimed tasks landed in "Evening" instead of "Anytime Today".

**Root Cause**: `MobileTodayView.vue` extracted time from `dueDate` (a date-only field) instead of checking the explicit `dueTime` field. Date-only strings like "2026-02-08" are parsed by `new Date()` as UTC midnight, which becomes 2:00 AM in Israel (UTC+2). The untimed task filter used `getHours() === 0` which only works in UTC+0 and fails in other timezones.

**Fix Applied (2026-02-08)**:
1. **Changed `getTaskHour()`** — Now uses `task.dueTime` instead of parsing time from `dueDate`
2. **Fixed untimed task filter** — Changed from `getHours() === 0` to `getTaskHour() === null`, making it timezone-agnostic
3. **Replaced `formatDueTime()`** — Now uses `getDueBadge()` which only shows time when explicit `dueTime` is set
4. **Fixed `sanitizeTimestamp()` in supabaseMappers.ts** — Preserves date-only strings (YYYY-MM-DD) instead of converting to UTC ISO

**Files Changed**:
- `src/mobile/views/MobileTodayView.vue` — Display and grouping fixes
- `src/utils/supabaseMappers.ts` — Preserve date-only strings

**Test Case**: Create a task with due date "2026-02-08" but no due time. In Israel (UTC+2), it should show "Anytime Today", not "2:00 AM".

### BUG-1204: Challenges Table 404 / Initialization Failure (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW (2026-02-07)

**Problem**: Console errors show `user_challenges` table returning 404 and `[Challenges] Initialization failed`. The challenges migration existed locally but was never applied to the VPS database.

**Root Cause**: VPS has no Supabase CLI migration tracking (`supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` doesn't exist). Migrations were applied manually via direct SQL but the challenges migration was missed.

**Additional Issue Found**: Two conflicting migration files existed (`20260206070234` and `20260206163002`) creating the same tables with different schemas. Code expected columns from both (e.g., `created_at`/`updated_at` from older, computed `completion_rate` from newer).

**Fix Applied (2026-02-07)**:
1. Merged both migrations into single canonical file (`20260206163002_challenges.sql`)
2. Deleted duplicate migration (`20260206070234_challenges.sql`)
3. Applied merged migration directly to VPS via SSH (`docker exec -i supabase-db psql`)
4. Verified PostgREST serves both endpoints (HTTP 200)

**Tables Created**: `user_challenges`, `challenge_history` (VPS now has 19 tables)
**Columns Added to `user_gamification`**: 9 new RPG fields (corruption, multiplier, class, counters)
**Also Created**: RLS policies, indexes, helper functions, auto-archive trigger, realtime subscription

**Known Remaining Issue**: `updateChallengeCounters()` uses `supabase.rpc('increment')` which doesn't exist — but the function is scaffolded MVP code that just logs (line 680). Not blocking.

**Errors**:
- `Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found) (user_challenges)` — **FIXED**
- `[Challenges] Initialization failed` — **FIXED** (pending user verification)

### ~~BUG-1205~~: "This Week" Sidebar Filter Includes Sunday (Next Week) (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: The "This Week" sidebar filter count includes tasks due on Sunday, but Sunday is the start of next week. The sidebar's `weekTaskCount` in `useSidebarManagement.ts` uses `<=` comparison instead of `<`, which includes Sunday in the week boundary.

**Root Cause**: `useSidebarManagement.ts` duplicates week-end logic from `useSmartViews.ts` but uses `<= weekEndStr` (includes Sunday) instead of `< weekEndStr` (excludes Sunday, consistent with the centralized `isWeekTask` filter).

**Fix**: Changed `<=` to `<` in all three date comparisons (dueDate, instances, scheduledDate) within `weekTaskCount` computed property. User confirmed working 2026-02-06.

**Files**: `src/composables/app/useSidebarManagement.ts`

### BUG-1210: "This Week" Filter Shows Tasks From Next Week (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: The "This Week" view/filter displays tasks due after Saturday 23:59 (next week). Two root causes:

**Root Cause 1**: `useTaskFiltering.ts` nested task bypass — child/subtasks added back WITHOUT re-applying smart view filter. Parent due this week pulled in ALL children regardless of dates.

**Root Cause 2**: `useSidebarManagement.ts` duplicated `weekTaskCount`/`todayTaskCount` with divergent logic (included all `in_progress` regardless of date, excluded overdue).

**Fix (code committed)**:
1. `useTaskFiltering.ts`: Apply `applySmartViewFilter()` to nested tasks before merging
2. `useSidebarManagement.ts`: Replaced duplicated count logic with centralized `useSmartViews` calls

**Pending**: Tauri auto-updater deploy (signing key password mismatch)

**Files**: `src/composables/tasks/useTaskFiltering.ts`, `src/composables/app/useSidebarManagement.ts`

### ~~TASK-1215~~: Persist Full UI State Across Restarts (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-08)

**Problem**: Several UI preferences reset on app restart — inbox advanced filters, All Tasks view type/sort/density, canvas display toggles (priority/status/duration badges), canvas snap/guides, and the task duration filter are all volatile.

**Approach**: Use VueUse `useStorage` (already a dependency, already used in 5 places) to persist the gaps. No new dependencies, no DB changes.

**Changes**:
1. `src/composables/inbox/useUnifiedInboxState.ts` — Persist advanced filters (priority, project, duration, unscheduled, showDone)
2. `src/views/AllTasksView.vue` — Persist viewType, density, sortBy
3. `src/stores/canvas/canvasUi.ts` — Persist display toggles + snap/guides
4. `src/stores/tasks/taskPersistence.ts` — Add missing `activeDurationFilter` to persisted filters
5. Key naming convention: `flowstate:` prefix with kebab-case

---

### ~~TASK-1246~~: Multi-Select Filters for Inbox (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-08)

**Change**: Converted priority, project, and duration inbox filters from single-select dropdowns to multi-select with checkboxes. OR logic within each filter, AND between filters. Calendar inbox filters now persist across refreshes.

**Files** (7):
- `src/composables/inbox/useUnifiedInboxState.ts` — Array-backed Sets with computed wrappers, `.has()` filter logic
- `src/composables/inbox/useCalendarInboxState.ts` — Same + added `usePersistentRef` for persistence
- `src/components/canvas/InboxFilters.vue` — Checkbox UI, `@click.stop` keeps dropdown open, count badges
- `src/components/inbox/unified/UnifiedInboxHeader.vue` — Plural Set props/emits
- `src/components/inbox/calendar/CalendarInboxHeader.vue` — Plural Set props/emits
- `src/components/inbox/UnifiedInboxPanel.vue` — Updated bindings + collapsed badge logic
- `src/components/inbox/CalendarInboxPanel.vue` — Updated v-model bindings

### BUG-1209: Comprehensive Canvas Position Drift - All Causes (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: Task positions still drift when moving tasks on canvas. 47 drift vectors identified across 6 subsystems. Subsumes BUG-1203, relates to BUG-1197.

**Root Cause (Systemic)**: Three position authorities (Vue Flow nodes, PositionManager, Pinia store) updated non-atomically through async operations, with 5 unsynchronized guard mechanisms.

**P0 Fixes (6)**:
1. `isDragging=false` moved to finally block — closes realtime overwrite window (`useCanvasInteractions.ts`)
2. Vue Flow node updates moved BEFORE store write — prevents sync reading inconsistent state (`useCanvasInteractions.ts`)
3. Position set BEFORE parentNode for tasks — eliminates micro-tick flash (`useCanvasInteractions.ts`)
4. `__FlowStateIsSettling` flag set in operationState — realtime handlers now block during settling (`useCanvasOperationState.ts`)
5. Online resume cooldown added — WiFi flickers no longer clobber in-flight drags (`useSupabaseDatabase.ts`)
6. PositionManager missing parent → return absolute — prevents double-offset drift (`PositionManager.ts`)

**P1 Fixes (4)**:
7. Grid-aligned positions — `Math.round()` before saving to prevent 16px snap accumulation (`useCanvasInteractions.ts`)
8. `isPendingWrite` check in `updateTaskFromSync` — defense-in-depth against recovery/merge bypassing realtime guard (`tasks.ts`)
9. Stale parentId cleanup uses `setTimeout(500ms)` instead of `nextTick` — breaks sync feedback loop (`useCanvasSync.ts`)
10. Unified `isPositionModificationBlocked` computed — single guard checking all state sources (`useCanvasOperationState.ts`)

**P2 Fixes (3)**:
11. `taskAllGroups` re-snapshot per iteration in multi-node drag loop (`useCanvasInteractions.ts`)
12. `await nextTick()` before descendant sync for fresh computedPosition (`useCanvasInteractions.ts`)
13. `removePendingWrite` delayed 3s to catch Supabase realtime echo (`useCanvasInteractions.ts`)

**Files Modified**: `useCanvasInteractions.ts`, `useCanvasOperationState.ts`, `useSupabaseDatabase.ts`, `PositionManager.ts`, `coordinates.ts`, `useCanvasSync.ts`, `tasks.ts`
**Tests**: 95/95 files pass, 616/616 tests pass

### BUG-1206: Task Details Not Saved When Pressing Save in Canvas (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: After editing task details (description) in the canvas edit modal and pressing Save, data appears lost when re-opening the modal. Save itself works (data persists in Supabase after full refresh). Bug is Tauri-specific - does NOT reproduce in browser/PWA guest mode.

**Root Cause Analysis** (3 vectors identified):
- **A (FIXED)**: Async rollback after modal close - removed rollback, added await (commit 0c92101)
- **B (Low risk)**: Realtime echo outside pendingWrites window - mitigated by timestamp checks
- **C (Most likely)**: Visibility change recovery clobber in Tauri/WebKitGTK - `loadFromDatabase()` smart merge may overwrite local with stale remote data when app loses/regains focus

**Progress (2026-02-06):** Added debug logging across 7 files to trace description data through save→sync→reopen cycle. Awaiting Tauri console output to pinpoint exact root cause.

**Files modified**: `useTaskEditActions.ts`, `tasks.ts`, `taskPersistence.ts`, `useTaskNodeActions.ts`, `useTaskEditState.ts`, `useAppInitialization.ts`, `taskOperations.ts`

### ~~BUG-1208~~: Task Edit Modal Closes on Text Selection Release (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: When selecting all text in the task details modal (e.g., triple-click or Ctrl+A on title field) and releasing the mouse, the modal closes unexpectedly. The `@click` handler on the overlay fires when `mouseup` from a text selection lands on the overlay backdrop.

**Root Cause**: `TaskEditModal.vue` line 4 uses `@click="$emit('close')"` on the overlay. When text selection starts inside `.modal-content` but the mouseup drifts onto the overlay, the browser fires a click event on the overlay, closing the modal.

**Fix**: Replace `@click` with `@mousedown.self` — only closes when the press *starts* on the overlay itself.

**Files**: `src/components/tasks/TaskEditModal.vue`

### ~~BUG-1207~~: Task Changes Reset in Tauri App (Board Position, Edits) (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: Changes made to tasks in the Tauri desktop app (e.g., board position/order, edits) get reverted/reset. Broader than canvas-only position drift (BUG-1203) — affects task mutations across views.

**Root Causes Found (7)**: Recovery reload clobbering edits (no cooldown on WebSocket retry), double `loadFromDatabase()` on startup, smart merge full-array replacement, 30s pendingWrite timeout too short, board position dead code, group sync no protection, PiniaSharedState global conflicts.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Recovery cooldown on ALL 3 paths (WebSocket retry + visibility + online) + `input` event tracking + 60s cooldown
- Dedup startup loads via `appInitLoadComplete` flag + reentrancy guard on `loadFromDatabase()`
- Granular in-place array updates instead of full `_rawTasks.value` replacement
- PendingWrites 120s safety fallback + explicit `removePendingWrite()` on sync completion
- Direct Supabase save preserved as primary (VPS-first), sync queue as backup
- Board position persistence: `event.moved` handler + `sortByOrder()` in grouping functions + `.order()` in fetchTasks
- Group sync: version/timestamp checks in `updateGroupFromSync` + `pendingGroupWrites` + `fromSupabaseGroup` mapper in post-login handler
- PiniaSharedState disabled globally (stores opt in individually)
- Canvas sync stale parent write-back removed (read-only invariant restored)
- Post-login handlers: added missing window flag checks (`__FlowStateIsDragging`, `__FlowStateIsResizing`, `__FlowStateIsSettling`)

### TASK-1177: Offline-First Sync System to Prevent Data Loss (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-01)

**Problem**: User lost significant work on production (in-theflow.com) due to silent sync failures.

**Root Causes Identified** (6 agents investigated):
1. **Silent error swallowing** (`taskOperations.ts:290-301`) - Save failures logged but not retried
2. **Smart merge drops tasks** (`taskPersistence.ts:272-287`) - Local-only tasks dropped after 5 min
3. **No write queue** - Failed writes lost forever
4. **Optimistic UI no rollback** - updateTask has no rollback on failure
5. **Sync timeout silent** (`useNodeSync.ts:252-256`) - Timeout errors explicitly silenced
6. **No beforeunload** - Can close tab with unsaved data

**Solution Architecture (Offline-First)**:

1. **Phase 1: Write Queue with IndexedDB** (P0)
   - All writes go to IndexedDB FIRST, then sync to Supabase
   - Retry with exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s... up to 60s max
   - 10 retry attempts before marking as "failed" (requires manual retry)
   - Never discard operations - persist until confirmed synced

2. **Phase 2: Sync Status Indicator** (P0)
   - Visual indicator in AppHeader.vue control panel
   - States: Synced (green), Syncing (blue), Pending (amber), Error (red), Offline (gray)
   - Error state NEVER auto-dismisses

3. **Phase 3: Fix Smart Merge Logic** (P0)
   - NEVER drop local-only tasks automatically
   - Queue for sync retry instead

4. **Phase 4: Add Rollback to updateTask** (P1)
   - Capture previous state before update
   - Rollback local state on failure

5. **Phase 5: beforeunload Protection** (P1)
   - Warn user before closing tab with unsaved changes

**Files to Create**:
- `src/types/sync.ts` - WriteOperation, WriteConflict, SyncStatus types
- `src/services/offline/writeQueueDB.ts` - Dexie.js IndexedDB schema
- `src/services/offline/operationSorter.ts` - Create→Update→Delete ordering
- `src/services/offline/operationCoalescer.ts` - Merge multiple updates
- `src/services/offline/retryStrategy.ts` - Exponential backoff calculation
- `src/composables/sync/useSyncOrchestrator.ts` - Main queue processing
- `src/stores/syncStatus.ts` - Pinia store for sync state
- `src/components/sync/SyncStatusIndicator.vue` - Header indicator
- `src/components/sync/SyncErrorPopover.vue` - Error details popover
- `src/composables/useBeforeUnload.ts` - Page close protection

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/stores/tasks/taskOperations.ts` - Use sync queue, add rollback
- `src/stores/tasks/taskPersistence.ts` - Fix smart merge, extend protection
- `src/stores/tasks.ts` - Fix 5s pending timeout
- `src/layouts/AppHeader.vue` - Add SyncStatusIndicator

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] User NEVER loses data, even with network failures
- [ ] User ALWAYS sees current sync status
- [ ] User CANNOT close tab with unsaved changes (without warning)
- [ ] Failed syncs retry automatically with backoff
- [ ] Offline edits persist across browser sessions
- [ ] Smart merge NEVER drops local-only tasks

### ~~BUG-1112~~: No Notification or Audio When Pomodoro Timer Finishes (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-02)

**Problem**: When the Pomodoro timer finishes a work/break session, there is no notification and no audio alert to inform the user.

**Root Cause**:
1. `silent: true` in Service Worker notification suppressed OS notification sounds
2. Audio volume was 0.1 (barely audible)
3. Service Worker disabled in dev mode (`devOptions.enabled: false`)
4. KDE Widget used pw-play which didn't work reliably

**Fix Applied**:
1. Changed `silent: false` in `src/sw.ts` and fallback notifications in `timer.ts`
2. Increased audio volume to 0.25-0.3 with 3-note chime
3. Enabled Service Worker in dev mode (`vite.config.ts`)
4. **Tauri Desktop**: Added native OS notification with `sound: 'default'` using `@tauri-apps/plugin-notification`
5. **KDE Widget (Plasma 6)**: System notification with FUNCTIONAL action buttons
   - Removed in-widget popup completely (user only wants system notification)
   - **Key fix**: Must use `Plasma5Support.DataSource` not `PlasmaCore.DataSource` for Plasma 6
   - Buttons call Supabase API directly to start next session
   - Bell sound via `paplay` (more reliable than `pw-play`)
   - Added `isKdeWidgetActive` computed in timer.ts to skip Tauri notification when widget active

**Files Changed**:
- `src/sw.ts`, `src/stores/timer.ts`, `vite.config.ts`
- `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.pomoflow.widget/contents/ui/main.qml`
- `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.pomoflow.widget/contents/scripts/notify.sh`

### ~~TASK-1183~~: Fix Tauri Production Sync Version Conflicts (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-02)

**Problem**: Tauri desktop app in production shows "Sync Errors - Version conflict - entity was modified by another device" when syncing with Supabase.

**Requirements**:
- **Bidirectional sync**: Tauri ↔ VPS ↔ Web (changes flow both directions)
- **Single source of truth**: VPS Supabase is authoritative
- **Multi-device support**: Same user on multiple devices must stay in sync

**Root Cause Found** (2026-02-02):
1. **BUG-1179** (Realtime drops) causes local `positionVersion` to become stale
2. Code uses **local cached version** (`task.positionVersion || 0`) at `taskOperations.ts:285`
3. When realtime drops, Device B has stale version (e.g., 4) while server has 5
4. UPDATE with `WHERE position_version = 4` returns 0 rows → false conflict

**Fix Applied** (2026-02-02):
Implemented **Last-Write-Wins (LWW)** auto-conflict resolution in `useSyncOrchestrator.ts`:

1. Try UPDATE with optimistic lock first (existing behavior)
2. If 0 rows returned (conflict), fetch current server state
3. Compare timestamps: `local.updated_at` vs `server.updated_at`
4. If local timestamp ≥ server: Force update without version check (local wins)
5. If server timestamp > local: Accept server version (stale local discarded)

**Benefits**:
- No user-facing "version conflict" errors
- Bidirectional sync works correctly
- Single source of truth (VPS) respected
- Handles offline/reconnect scenarios gracefully

**Files Changed**:
- `src/composables/sync/useSyncOrchestrator.ts` - Added LWW resolution logic
- `src/types/sync.ts` - Added `serverData` to SyncResult type
- `src/stores/canvas/canvasGroups.ts` - Fixed group IDs to use proper UUIDs
- `src/utils/supabaseMappers.ts` - Added UUID validation for groups and task parentId
- `src/stores/projects.ts` - Fixed 'uncategorized' → null for projectId
- `src/services/offline/retryStrategy.ts` - Permanent error classification for data validation
- `src/components/sync/SyncErrorPopover.vue` - "Corrupted" badge, smart Retry button
- `src/stores/tasks.ts` - Added cleanupCorruptedTasks()
- `src/components/settings/tabs/StorageSettingsTab.vue` - Data Cleanup section

**Related**: BUG-1179 (Realtime Drops) - should still be fixed to reduce conflicts

### ~~BUG-1185~~: Timer Auto-Continues After Session Completes (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-04)

**Problem**: Timer automatically starts a new 25-minute session after break/work completes, without waiting for user to choose "Start Work" or "+5 min".

**Root Causes Found**:
1. `completeSession()` in `timer.ts` did NOT save `is_active=false` to Supabase — session stayed active in DB, could be picked up by sync
2. Service Worker notification body click auto-started opposite session type — accidental clicks triggered new sessions

**Fix**:
- Added DB save in `completeSession()` to mark session inactive (matching `stopTimer()` behavior)
- Changed notification body click to only focus window, not start a timer (action buttons still work)

**Files**: `src/stores/timer.ts`, `src/sw.ts`

### BUG-1186: Tauri Today Group Not Counting Tasks or Moving Children (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED (2026-02-03)

**Problem**: In Tauri desktop app, the "Today" smart group has two issues:
1. **Badge not counting tasks** - The task count badge stopped showing the correct number
2. **Children don't move with group** - When dragging the Today group, child tasks don't follow

**Context**: This is Tauri-specific - may be related to recent sync changes or group handling differences between web and desktop.

**Investigation Steps**:
- [ ] Check if Today group exists and has correct `filter_type`
- [ ] Verify task-to-group relationship (parentId matching)
- [ ] Compare behavior between web and Tauri builds
- [ ] Check console for errors when dragging group

**Files to Investigate**:
- `src/stores/canvas/canvasGroups.ts` - Group logic
- `src/composables/canvas/useCanvasSync.ts` - Sync handling
- `src/components/canvas/GroupNode.vue` - Badge display

---

### ~~BUG-1187~~: "Done for now" Badge Resets and Doesn't Persist (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: The "Done for now" badge on tasks gets reset automatically and doesn't persist across sessions or refreshes.

**Root Causes Found**:
1. The `doneForNowUntil` field was NOT included in the sync payload sent to Supabase
2. Badge display logic (`dueDate === doneForNowUntil`) was fragile - any dueDate change hid it

**Fix Applied**:
- [x] Added `done_for_now_until` to updateTask sync payload (`taskOperations.ts`)
- [x] Added `done_for_now_until` to createTask sync payload (`taskOperations.ts`)
- [x] Changed badge logic to show when `doneForNowUntil` has any value, not just matching dates (`TaskNodeMeta.vue`)

**Files Changed**:
- `src/stores/tasks/taskOperations.ts` - Added `done_for_now_until` to sync payloads
- `src/components/canvas/node/TaskNodeMeta.vue` - Badge shows when `doneForNowUntil` exists

---

### ~~BUG-1188~~: Today View Shows Non-Today Tasks Due to Hidden Hour Data (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-03)

**Problem**: Tasks scheduled for future dates were incorrectly appearing in the "Today" smart view due to stale legacy `scheduledDate` field values conflicting with the newer instances-based scheduling system.

**Root Cause**: The smart view filters checked BOTH `task.instances[].scheduledDate` (new system, authoritative) AND `task.scheduledDate` (legacy field, may have stale data). When a task had instances with future dates but the legacy `scheduledDate` field contained "today", the filter incorrectly included the task.

**Fix Applied**:
- [x] Fixed `isTodayTask()` in `useSmartViews.ts` - When instances exist, ONLY check instance dates (skip legacy scheduledDate)
- [x] Fixed `isWeekTask()` in `useSmartViews.ts` - Same fix, instances are authoritative
- [x] Fixed `isThisMonthTask()` in `useSmartViews.ts` - Same fix, instances are authoritative
- [x] Fixed `useCalendarDrag.ts` - Clear legacy `scheduledDate`/`scheduledTime` when creating instances to prevent future stale data

**Files Changed**:
- `src/composables/useSmartViews.ts` - Prioritize instances over legacy field in all smart view filters
- `src/composables/calendar/useCalendarDrag.ts` - Clear legacy fields when creating instances

### BUG-1184: Production Site Down - Chunk Load Failure + Network Errors (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-02)

**Problem**: Production site at `in-theflow.com` is broken with two critical issues:

1. **Chunk Load Failure**:
   ```
   error loading dynamically imported module: https://in-theflow.com/assets/AllTasksView-BA62OH4U.js
   ```

2. **Network Errors on All Sync Operations**:
   - `fetchActiveTimerSession`: NetworkError
   - `fetchGroups`: NetworkError
   - `fetchTasks`: NetworkError
   - `fetchProjects`: NetworkError
   - `fetchNotifications`: NetworkError
   - `fetchQuickSortHistory`: NetworkError

**Symptoms**:
- UI loads but shows "No tasks yet"
- Multiple sync error popups appear
- All Supabase API calls fail with "NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource"

**Likely Causes**:
1. Stale build deployed - chunk hash mismatch between index.html and actual assets
2. VPS Supabase service down or unreachable
3. CORS misconfiguration after recent changes
4. Caddy reverse proxy issue

**Investigation Steps**:
- [ ] Check if VPS is reachable: `ssh root@84.46.253.137`
- [ ] Check Caddy status: `systemctl status caddy`
- [ ] Check Supabase status: `cd /opt/supabase/docker && docker compose ps`
- [ ] Check if chunk file exists: `ls -la /var/www/flowstate/assets/AllTasksView*`
- [ ] Check CORS headers: `curl -I https://api.in-theflow.com/rest/v1/`
- [ ] Redeploy if needed: `doppler run -- npm run build && rsync -avz dist/ root@84.46.253.137:/var/www/flowstate/`

**Files**: VPS `/var/www/flowstate/`, `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`, `/opt/supabase/docker/`

### BUG-1113: Stale Worktrees Not Cleaned Up - Forces Claude Code Context Bloat (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS | **Parent**: TASK-303

**Problem**: The Dev-Maestro orchestrator creates git worktrees in `.agent-worktrees/` for each task but does not clean them up after completion. These stale directories force Claude Code to load them into context, wasting tokens and causing confusion.

**Evidence** (2026-01-27):
```
.agent-worktrees/
├── orch-audit-task-1/   # Jan 20 - 10+ days old
├── orch-audit-task-2/
├── orch-audit-task-3/
├── orch-task-1/         # Jan 18 - 12+ days old
├── task-1 through task-18/  # Jan 27 - multiple stale worktrees
```

**Impact**:
1. Claude Code loads all these directories into context on startup
2. Wastes context tokens on stale/irrelevant code
3. Git worktrees consume disk space (~100MB+ each)
4. Confuses Claude when it sees duplicate file structures

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Worktrees should be cleaned up after task completion (merge OR discard)
2. Automatic cleanup of worktrees older than 24 hours
3. Manual cleanup command available in UI

**Related**: BUG-1019 (Swarm agent cleanup + OOM prevention)

**Files**: `~/.dev-maestro/server.js` (`cleanupWorktree()`, `createAgentWorktree()`)

### ~~BUG-1121~~: KDE Plasma Widget Dropdown Options Disappearing (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-02)

**Problem**: In the KDE Plasma widget task list, dropdown menus (sort order, filter) were cutting off options. Only 2 of 4 options were visible/pickable.

**Root Cause**: Using `QQC2.ComboBox` (Qt Quick Controls 2) in Plasma widgets causes popup clipping issues because the widget's `fullRepresentation` is not a top-level window. The popup gets clipped by parent container boundaries.

**Solution**: Replace `QQC2.ComboBox` with `PlasmaComponents.ComboBox` which is specifically designed for Plasma widgets and handles popup positioning correctly. Custom styling (background, contentItem, indicator) can still be applied for glass morphism look.

**Key Learning**: In KDE Plasma 6 widgets, always use `PlasmaComponents.ComboBox` instead of `QQC2.ComboBox` for dropdowns to ensure proper popup handling.

**SOP Created**: `docs/sop/SOP-041-kde-widget-combobox-popup.md`

**Files**: `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.pomoflow.widget/contents/ui/main.qml`

### ~~BUG-1122~~: KDE Widget Lost Timer Sync with Web App and Tauri (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-02)

**Problem**: KDE Plasma widget has lost timer sync with BOTH the web app and Tauri desktop app. Timer state changes are not reflecting across devices.

**Root Cause**:
1. Timer session in DB has stale leader heartbeat (2+ hours old)
2. KDE widget only checked `device_leader_id === "kde-widget"` without checking for stale leadership
3. Web/Tauri follower poll didn't take over when leader heartbeat was stale
4. All devices stayed as "followers" waiting for a dead leader

**Fix Applied**:
1. **KDE Widget** (`~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.pomoflow.widget/contents/ui/main.qml`):
   - Added stale leadership detection (30 second timeout)
   - Widget now claims leadership when leader heartbeat is stale
   - Calls `patchSession()` to update `device_leader_id` to "kde-widget"

2. **Web/Tauri App** (`src/stores/timer.ts`):
   - Added stale leadership check to follower poll
   - Follower now claims leadership if heartbeat is older than `DEVICE_LEADER_TIMEOUT_MS` (30s)
   - Starts heartbeat and stops follower polling after claiming

**Files Changed**: `src/stores/timer.ts`, `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.pomoflow.widget/contents/ui/main.qml`

### ~~BUG-1178~~: Break Button in Timer Notification Doesn't Start Break Timer (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-02)

**Problem**: Clicking "Break" button in work-complete notification doesn't start break timer. After break completes, no popup with "Start Work" / "+5 min".

**Root Cause**: SW message listener registered before SW controller was ready + race condition where message sent before window fully focused.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Wait for `navigator.serviceWorker.ready` before registering message listener (`timer.ts`)
2. Add 100ms delay after focusing window before sending message (`sw.ts`)
3. URL query param fallback when opening new window (`useAppInitialization.ts`)
4. Enhanced debug logging throughout SW message flow

**Files Changed**: `src/stores/timer.ts`, `src/sw.ts`, `src/composables/app/useAppInitialization.ts`

### ~~BUG-1179~~: Supabase Realtime Connection Drops (CHANNEL_ERROR/CLOSED) (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-03)

**Problem**: Production console shows repeated realtime connection drops:
```
📡 [REALTIME] Connection dropped (CHANNEL_ERROR): unknown reason
📡 [REALTIME] Connection dropped (CLOSED): unknown reason
```

**Impact**: Causes `saveTasks` failures and potential data loss if writes happen during disconnect.

**Investigation Results** (2026-02-02):
1. ✅ VPS Caddy WebSocket headers already correct (checked `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`)
2. 🔍 Supabase Realtime logs show: `Killing X transport pids with no channels open`
3. 🔍 Cloudflare has 100-second idle timeout for WebSockets
4. ❌ Supabase client had NO realtime configuration (using defaults)

**Root Cause**: Default Supabase heartbeat interval (25s) may be too infrequent, and idle connections are being killed by Supabase Realtime garbage collection.

**Fix Applied** (2026-02-02):
Added realtime configuration to Supabase client in `src/services/auth/supabase.ts`:
```typescript
realtime: {
    heartbeatIntervalMs: 15000,  // More frequent heartbeats (was 25s)
    reconnectAfterMs: (tries) => Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, tries), 30000),
    log_level: import.meta.env.DEV ? 'info' : 'error',
}
```

**Awaiting**: User verification - monitor console for connection drops after refresh

### ~~BUG-1180~~: Ollama Localhost CORS Errors in Production (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-03)

**Problem**: Production site (`in-theflow.com`) attempts to call `localhost:11434` (Ollama), which fails with CORS:
```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: http://localhost:11434/api/tags
(Reason: CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' missing). Status code: 403.
```

**Root Cause**: AI provider detection runs in browser, checks if Ollama is available locally. Works on localhost dev, but CORS blocks it from production domain.

**Fix Applied** (2026-02-02):
- Added production domain check in `createOllamaProvider()` - skips Ollama detection when:
  - Running on non-localhost domain AND
  - `VITE_OLLAMA_HOST` env var is NOT set
- Users who want Ollama from production can set `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=https://in-theflow.com` on their Ollama instance AND set `VITE_OLLAMA_HOST` to enable detection

**Files Changed**: `src/services/ai/router.ts`

**Awaiting**: User verification on production

### TASK-1186: Make AI Accessible in Tauri App (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: AI features (Ollama local, Groq/OpenRouter cloud) reliability in Tauri desktop context is unknown. Key concerns:
1. **Ollama detection skipped** on "production domains" (BUG-1180) - may incorrectly skip in Tauri
2. **Cloud AI requires internet** + Supabase Edge Functions - not offline-capable
3. **No CORS-free HTTP** - Browser fetch in Tauri WebView has same CORS restrictions

**Current Architecture**:
| Provider | Method | Works Offline? |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Ollama | localhost:11434 | Yes (if running) |
| Groq | Direct API | No |
| OpenRouter | Edge Function proxy | No |

**Progress (2026-02-06)**:
- ✅ **Groq Provider Added** - Direct API calls to `api.groq.com` (no edge function needed)
- ✅ **Provider Visibility Badge** - Shows "Local"/"Groq"/"OpenRouter" in chat header
- ✅ **Provider/Model Switcher** - Settings dropdown to switch between Auto/Groq/Local + model picker
- ✅ **Tool Execution System** - AI can create groups, tasks, list items via `src/services/ai/tools.ts`
- ✅ **Hebrew Language Support** - AI responds in user's language
- ✅ **Conversational Behavior** - Only uses tools when user explicitly asks to create/modify

**Solution**:
1. ~~**Phase 1: Fix Tauri Detection**~~ - ✅ DONE - Removed hard block, graceful Ollama detection
2. **Phase 2: Tauri HTTP Plugin** - Use `@tauri-apps/plugin-http` for CORS-free Ollama requests

### BUG-1181: Cloudflare Insights SRI Hash Mismatch (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P3-LOW | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED (2026-02-02)

**Problem**: Console shows integrity hash mismatch for Cloudflare beacon script:
```
None of the "sha512" hashes in the integrity attribute match the content of the subresource at
"https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js/..."
```

**Root Cause**: Cloudflare updates their beacon.min.js periodically, but the HTML references a cached integrity hash.

**Impact**: Low - Cloudflare analytics may not load, but app functionality unaffected.

**Fix**: Remove integrity attribute from Cloudflare script tag, or let Cloudflare CDN handle it automatically.

**Files**: `index.html` or Cloudflare dashboard Web Analytics settings

### ~~BUG-1189~~: Can't Drag Tasks from Overdue Swimlane in My Projects (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: In the Board view (Date view), tasks cannot be dragged from the "Overdue" column to other columns. The task appears to move but snaps back to Overdue.

**Root Cause Found**:
1. `moveTaskToDate()` only updated `instances`, not `dueDate`
2. `groupTasksByDate()` checks BOTH `task.dueDate` AND `instances` for overdue status
3. If a task had a past `dueDate`, it stayed stuck in Overdue even after updating instances
4. Missing handling for 'inbox' and 'noDate' columns in `moveTaskToDate()`

**Fix Applied**:
- [x] Added handling for 'inbox' column (sets `isInInbox: true`, clears dates)
- [x] Added handling for 'noDate' column (clears all date info)
- [x] When moving a task with an overdue `dueDate`, update `dueDate` to the target date

**Files Changed**:
- `src/stores/tasks/taskOperations.ts` - Fixed `moveTaskToDate()` function

**Verification**: User should test by:
1. Switch to Board view → Due Date view
2. Find a task in the "Overdue" column
3. Drag it to "Today" or "Tomorrow"
4. Task should move and STAY in the target column
5. Also test dragging to "Inbox" and "No Date" columns

**Root Cause**: Likely the optimistic update happens but Supabase write fails silently. No retry or rollback.

### ~~BUG-1190~~: Subtasks Not Saved, Poor Design, Missing Badge (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: Three subtask-related issues:
1. **Subtasks not saved** - After editing a main task and pressing Save, subtasks are not persisted
2. **Poor subtask design** - The subtask UI in the main task editing panel needs visual improvement
3. **Missing subtask badge** - Tasks with subtasks show no indicator/badge in the UI (Board, Canvas, Calendar views)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Subtasks persist correctly when saving the parent task
- [ ] Subtask section in task editor has clean, polished design
- [ ] Tasks with subtasks show a badge/count indicator across all views

**Impact**: User thinks task is saved, but it's lost on refresh.

**Fix**: This is addressed by TASK-1177 (Offline-First Sync) which adds:
- Write queue with IndexedDB persistence
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Visual sync status indicator
- Rollback on failure

**Blocked By**: TASK-1177

### ~~BUG-1191~~: Overdue Badge Logic Inverted for Today Group Tasks (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: Overdue badges on tasks have inverted behavior related to the Today group:
1. **Tasks staying in Today group** that become overdue → badge does NOT appear (should show)
2. **Tasks moved OUT of Today group** that are overdue → badge does NOT appear (should show)
3. **Tasks returned TO Today group** → badge DOES appear (should NOT, because the due date should be updated to today on move)

**Root Cause**: `new Date()` inside Vue `computed()` is NOT a reactive dependency. Computeds cache results until reactive dependencies change. Since time isn't reactive, overdue badges never update when midnight passes.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created `src/composables/useReactiveDate.ts` with reactive `reactiveToday` ref that updates every 60 seconds
- Updated all overdue computations to depend on `reactiveToday.value` (creates reactive dependency)
- At midnight, ref updates → all overdue computeds re-evaluate → badges appear/disappear correctly

**Files Changed**:
- `src/composables/useReactiveDate.ts` (NEW)
- `src/composables/canvas/node/useTaskNodeState.ts`
- `src/components/kanban/card/TaskCardBadges.vue`
- `src/components/inbox/unified/UnifiedInboxTaskCard.vue`
- `src/components/inbox/calendar/CalendarTaskCard.vue`

### ~~BUG-1192~~: Canvas Inbox Double-Click Opens Selection Instead of Edit Menu (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: Three issues with canvas inbox task interactions:
1. **Double-click** on a task in the canvas inbox should open the edit menu — currently triggers selection
2. **Ctrl+Click** should toggle multi-selection — currently not the trigger for selection toolbar
3. **Multi-selection toolbar** styling doesn't use design tokens — needs sync with visual system

**Solution**:
- Added `multiSelectActive` flag to separate "highlighted" (single click) from "multi-selected" (Ctrl/Shift click)
- Single click now highlights task visually but does NOT show selection bar
- Ctrl+Click and Shift+Click activate multi-select mode and show the selection bar
- Updated selection bar CSS to use glass morphism design tokens instead of solid brand-primary

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Double-clicking a task in canvas inbox opens the task edit panel
- [x] Ctrl+Click toggles task selection (shows multi-selection toolbar)
- [x] Multi-selection toolbar uses design tokens (colors, spacing, border-radius)
- [x] Regular single-click highlights task without showing selection bar

**Files**:
- `src/composables/inbox/useUnifiedInboxActions.ts` - Click behavior logic
- `src/components/inbox/unified/UnifiedInboxList.vue` - Selection bar CSS

### ~~BUG-1193~~: Kanban Drag-and-Drop Deep Regression - Drags Wrong Tasks, Groups Don't Move Children (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: Deep regression in Kanban/Board view drag-and-drop:
1. Dragging a task in kanban drags unrelated tasks instead
2. Group drag doesn't move child tasks
3. Tauri app and main app don't sync at all

**Root Cause**:
1. `group="tasks"` was a static string shared across ALL swimlanes - vuedraggable allowed cross-project drag
2. `localTasks` watch fired during drag, overwriting vuedraggable's internal state causing wrong element selection
3. `createTask` sync threw error when auth unavailable, breaking entire task creation
4. Legacy canvas groups with `group-xxx` IDs threw error on sync instead of gracefully skipping

**Fix Applied**:
- **KanbanColumn.vue**: Scoped drag group per swimlane (`:group="dragGroup"` with `tasks-{projectId}`), added `isDragActive` guard to prevent reactive overwrites during drag, added `@start`/`@end` handlers
- **KanbanSwimlane.vue**: Pass `:swimlane-id="project.id"` to all KanbanColumn instances
- **taskOperations.ts**: Changed auth check from throw to graceful skip for sync queue, fixed TypeScript errors (`dueDate: undefined` instead of `null`)
- **supabaseMappers.ts**: Changed `toSupabaseGroup` to return `null` and warn for legacy IDs instead of throwing

### ~~BUG-1183~~: Production App Crash - Circular Dependency in Vite Chunks (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-02)

**Problem**: Production app crashes on load with error:
```
ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'Ie' before initialization
    Ye vue-vendor-DkWNH6qz.js:2
    <anonymous> naive-ui-CbR0xL5r.js:33
```

**Root Cause**: Vite's manualChunks split `naive-ui` and `vue-vendor` into separate chunks. When loaded in parallel, naive-ui tried to access Vue before it was initialized.

**Fix Applied**: Combined naive-ui into vue-vendor chunk in `vite.config.ts`:
```typescript
if (id.includes('vue') || id.includes('pinia') || id.includes('vue-router') || id.includes('naive-ui')) {
  return 'vue-vendor'
}
```

**Files Changed**: `vite.config.ts`

### ~~BUG-1129~~: Quick Sort Project Buttons Truncating Names on Desktop (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-31)

**Problem**: In the Quick Sort view on desktop, project category buttons have fixed width causing long project names to be truncated with ellipsis. Hebrew text "נטלי כה..." and other long names are cut off.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Changed `.category-grid` from fixed grid to flexbox (`flex-wrap: wrap`)
2. Added `title` attribute to project names for hover tooltip
3. Buttons now size to content naturally with `min-width: 120px`
4. Set `max-width: 250px` on text to prevent overly long names
5. Mobile responsive: full width buttons on small screens

**Files**: `src/components/layout/CategorySelector.vue`

### ~~TASK-1130~~: QuickSort Desktop UX/UI Comprehensive Improvements (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-02)

**Problem**: Desktop QuickSort view has multiple UX issues preventing efficient task categorization:
1. Cannot view as "one-pager" - requires scrolling (850-1050px content vs 900px viewport)
2. Task titles scroll out of view when viewing project options (context loss)
3. Project names truncated, especially Hebrew/RTL text ("נטלי כה...")
4. Keyboard shortcuts (1-9) exist but badges are hidden (`display: none`)

**Solution Applied - Single-Column Focus Layout** (2026-02-02):
Instead of the original 3-phase plan, implemented a radical simplification:
- [x] Converted from 2-column to single-column centered layout (max 600px)
- [x] Combined priority + date shortcuts into one compact row
- [x] Moved action buttons (Done/Skip/Edit/Undo) to consolidated bottom row
- [x] Removed redundant metadata display and "MOVE TO PROJECT" header
- [x] Simplified date shortcuts: Tomorrow → +1, Next Week → +7, removed Weekend
- [x] Task title is now the hero element with clear vertical flow

### ~~BUG-1176~~: Done Tasks Sometimes Remain Visible on Canvas (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-31)

**Problem**: When a task is marked as "Done", it sometimes remains visible on the canvas instead of being hidden/removed.

**Root Cause**: `useCanvasSync.ts` synced ALL tasks with `canvasPosition` regardless of status, bypassing the `hideCanvasDoneTasks` flag that exists in `useCanvasFilteredState.ts`.

**Fix Applied**: Added done-task filter to `syncStoreToCanvas()` function:
```typescript
const shouldHideDone = taskStore.hideCanvasDoneTasks
const tasksToSync = (tasks || taskStore.tasks)
    .filter(t => t.canvasPosition)
    .filter(t => !shouldHideDone || t.status !== 'done')
```

### ~~BUG-1122~~: KDE Widget Lost Timer Sync with Web App and Tauri (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-02)

**Problem**: KDE Plasma widget has lost timer sync with BOTH the web app and Tauri desktop app.

**Root Cause**: Timer session had stale leader heartbeat (2+ hours), all devices stayed as "followers" waiting for dead leader. Fixed by adding stale leadership detection (30s timeout) to both KDE widget and web/Tauri app.

**Files Changed**: `src/stores/timer.ts`, `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.pomoflow.widget/contents/ui/main.qml`
- Compare timer session IDs across all three apps
- Verify KDE widget is polling/subscribing to correct Supabase endpoint

### ~~BUG-1123~~: Tauri Desktop App Performance Issues (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-02)

**Problem**: Performance issues reported in Tauri desktop application. Main bundle was 1.9MB monolithic file.

**Root Cause**: No vendor chunking in vite.config.ts - all dependencies bundled into single index.js

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `manualChunks` configuration to vite.config.ts
- Split vendors: vue-vendor, naive-ui, tiptap, supabase, vueuse, date-fns, tauri
- Main bundle reduced from 1.9MB → 729KB (61% reduction)

**Results**:
| Bundle | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| index.js | 1.9MB | 729KB |
| vue-vendor | - | 758KB |
| naive-ui | - | 433KB |
| tiptap | - | 392KB |

**Files Changed**: `vite.config.ts`

### ~~BUG-1124~~: Task Positions Don't Sync Between Tauri App and Web App (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-02)

**Problem**: Task positions on canvas didn't sync correctly between the production Tauri desktop app and the web app (PWA). Changes made in one didn't reflect properly in the other.

**Root Causes Found**:
1. Group realtime handler wasn't using `fromSupabaseGroup` mapper - `position_json` from DB was passed as-is instead of mapped to `position`
2. Task position version logic blocked cross-device sync - when versions matched, local was always preserved instead of comparing timestamps

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Added `fromSupabaseGroup` mapper to realtime handler in `useAppInitialization.ts`
2. Updated position version logic in `tasks.ts` to compare `updatedAt` timestamps when versions equal
3. Extended pending write timeout from 5s to 30s to handle VPS latency

**SOP**: `docs/sop/SOP-040-cross-device-position-sync.md`

**Related**: TASK-131 (position reset issues), TASK-142 (positions reset on refresh)

### ~~BUG-1125~~: Canvas Edge/Cable Connections Between Nodes Broken (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-31)

**Problem**: Connecting cables/edges between nodes on the canvas is broken. Users cannot create new connections between tasks/groups. Affects both local dev and Tauri desktop app.

**Root Cause**: The `Handle` component from Vue Flow was lazy-loaded with `defineAsyncComponent`, causing timing issues where Vue Flow couldn't register connection handles during node mount in dev/Tauri environments. Production builds worked because bundling made the component available synchronously.

**Fix**: Changed from lazy loading to direct import in `TaskNode.vue`.

**Files**: `src/components/canvas/TaskNode.vue`

---

### ~~BUG-1126~~: Group Created at Wrong Location (Not Where Clicked) (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-02)

**Problem**: When right-clicking on the canvas to create a new group, the group does not appear at the clicked location.

**Root Cause**: `screenToFlowCoordinate` had issues with container offset detection. Also, `canvasGroups.ts` was hardcoding `parentGroupId: null` and `UnifiedGroupModal.vue` was converting to relative coords instead of keeping absolute (violating Fully Absolute Architecture).

**Fix**:
- Manual coordinate conversion using `getBoundingClientRect()` in `useCanvasGroupActions.ts`
- Preserved `parentGroupId` from groupData in `canvasGroups.ts`
- Kept absolute position for nested groups in `UnifiedGroupModal.vue`

**Files**: `src/composables/canvas/useCanvasGroupActions.ts`, `src/stores/canvas/canvasGroups.ts`, `src/components/canvas/UnifiedGroupModal.vue`

---

### BUG-1127: Cannot Create Group Inside Another Group (Nested Groups) (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Problem**: It's not possible to create a new group inside an existing group. Nested group creation is blocked or ignored.

**Root Cause**: The "Create Group" button in `CanvasContextMenu.vue` had `v-if="!contextSection"` which explicitly hid it when right-clicking inside a group.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Removed `v-if="!contextSection"` from Create Group button
2. Groups use position-based containment (like tasks) - no parentId needed

**Files Changed**: `src/components/canvas/CanvasContextMenu.vue`

**Files**: `src/composables/canvas/useCanvasGroups.ts`, `src/composables/canvas/useCanvasActions.ts`

---

### TASK-1128: Add "Create Group From Selection" Context Menu Option (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-04)

**Feature**: When multiple tasks are selected on canvas, right-click should show "Add to New Group" option that:
1. Creates a new group at the bounding box location of selected tasks
2. Automatically parents all selected tasks to the new group
3. Sizes the group to contain all selected tasks with padding

**Implementation**:
- [x] Add context menu option when `selectedNodes.length > 1`
- [x] Calculate bounding box of selected nodes
- [x] Create group with appropriate position and dimensions
- [x] Update selected tasks' parentId to new group

**Awaiting**: User verification

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/canvas/CanvasContextMenu.vue` - Added "Add to New Group" menu option
- `src/components/canvas/CanvasContextMenus.vue` - Event forwarding
- `src/composables/canvas/useCanvasActions.ts` - `createGroupFromSelection()` implementation
- `src/views/CanvasView.vue` - Wired up event handler

### ~~BUG-1097~~: Due Date Not Persisting from Edit Modal (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-30)

**Symptoms**:
1. Due date in Edit Task modal shows previous date, not current - even after opening modal on task WITH a date
2. Due date changes from modal don't persist on refresh
3. Canvas overdue reschedule badge updates card display but doesn't save to database

**Investigation**: `TaskEditMetadata.vue` logging traces date values through flow.

**Files**: `src/components/tasks/TaskEditMetadata.vue`, `src/composables/tasks/useTaskEditActions.ts`

### ~~BUG-1099~~: VPS: Done Tasks Not Filtered Until Refresh - ReferenceError (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-30)

**Problem**: On VPS production (in-theflow.com), completed/done tasks appear on canvas when they should be hidden. They only disappear after a page refresh.

**Console Error**:
```
ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'xe' before initialization
    xe https://in-theflow.com/assets/CanvasView-DB2EuB-i.js:27
```

**Root Cause**: Circular dependency chain causing Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) error:
`CanvasView → useCanvasOrchestrator → useCanvasFilteredState → @/stores/tasks → @/stores/canvas → circular!`

Type imports from `@/stores/tasks` instead of `@/types/tasks` triggered module evaluation during bundling.

**Fix Applied (2026-01-30)**:
1. Changed type imports in 4 files from `@/stores/tasks` → `@/types/tasks`:
   - `useCanvasFilteredState.ts`
   - `useCanvasGroups.ts`
   - `useCanvasSectionProperties.ts`
   - `stores/canvas/modals.ts`
2. Made `tasks.ts` → `canvas.ts` import dynamic to break runtime cycle

**Verification**: Build succeeds, tests pass. Needs VPS deployment + manual testing.

### BUG-1103: Local Dev Auth Signs Out Both Tabs on Second Tab Sign-In (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-01-28)

**Problem**: In local development, when user has two browser tabs open:
1. Sign in on first tab - works
2. Open second tab and try to sign in
3. Both tabs get signed out

**Symptoms**: Auth session not persisting across multiple browser tab instances during local development.

**Likely Causes**:
1. Session token overwrite/conflict between tabs
2. `onAuthStateChange` listener firing logout event to all tabs
3. Supabase local storage key collision
4. Race condition in auth initialization across tabs

**Files to Investigate**: `src/stores/auth.ts`, `src/services/auth/supabase.ts`

**Related**: BUG-1086 (auth persistence issues on VPS)

---

### ~~BUG-1111~~: Tauri Desktop App Not Syncing from Main Database (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-30)

**Problem**: Tauri desktop app doesn't sync data from the main Supabase database. Tasks/groups created on web app don't appear in Tauri app.

**Root Cause**: `.env.production` had the correct VPS URL but the **wrong ANON_KEY** (demo key instead of production key). When `tauri build` runs, Vite uses `.env.production` which baked the demo JWT into the bundle.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Fixed `.env.production` with correct production ANON_KEY (signed by VPS JWT_SECRET)
2. Rebuilt Tauri app with `npx tauri build`
3. Created `FlowState-Dev.desktop` launcher for dev mode workflow

**Files Changed**: `.env.production`, `FlowState-Dev.desktop` (new)

**Dev Workflow Improvement**: Added "FlowState (Dev)" desktop launcher that runs `npm run tauri` directly - no need to rebuild deb for testing

### BUG-1086: VPS/PWA Auth Not Persisting + Blank Screen (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW (2026-01-26)
**SOP**: `docs/sop/SOP-035-auth-initialization-race-fix.md`

**Root Cause**: Triple auth initialization race condition - 3 places called `authStore.initialize()` simultaneously.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Removed fire-and-forget init from `AppSidebar.vue`
2. Added promise lock (`initPromise`) in `auth.ts`
3. Added `handledSignInForUserId` guard for duplicate `SIGNED_IN` events

**Files**: `src/stores/auth.ts`, `src/layouts/AppSidebar.vue`

**Verification Pending**: User must confirm single init log, sign-in persistence across refresh/browser close.

### BUG-1061: Canvas Position Drift on Cross-Browser Sync (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW (2026-01-25)

**Problem**: Tasks appear in different positions across browser tabs.

**Existing Protections** (all implemented):
| Protection | Location |
|------------|----------|
| Timestamp comparison | `tasks.ts:195` |
| Manual operation lock | `tasks.ts:190-191` |
| Drag/resize locks | `useAppInitialization.ts:128-132` |
| PositionManager locks | `PositionManager.ts:36-38` |

**Fixes Applied** (5 total):
1. **Fix #1**: Added `positionVersion` comparison in `updateTaskFromSync` (`tasks.ts`)
2. **Fix #2**: Read `parentId` from store, not PositionManager (`useCanvasSync.ts`)
3. **Fix #3**: Skip parentId recalc when task follows parent group (`useCanvasInteractions.ts`)
4. **Fix #5**: `canvasSyncInProgress` flag blocks spurious `onNodeDragStop` (`useCanvasSync.ts`, `useCanvasInteractions.ts`)

**Verification**: Console shows `[DRAG-STOP-BLOCKED]` when spurious calls blocked.

### BUG-352: Mobile PWA "Failed to Fetch" (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED

Mobile device fails to fetch on fresh browser. Potential causes: SSL/Cert issue with `sslip.io`, mobile-specific hardcoded localhost, stricter CORS.

---

### ~~BUG-1107~~: PWA Mobile - Sync Error fetchGroups Failed to Fetch (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-31)

**Problem**: Mobile PWA shows sync error during fetchGroups - `TypeError: Failed to fetch` in fetch → fetchAndCache flow.

**Root Cause**: Multiple fetch functions were missing `withRetry()` wrapper. Network failures on mobile weren't being retried with exponential backoff.

**Fix Applied**: Added `withRetry()` to ALL fetch functions:
- `fetchGroups()`
- `fetchActiveTimerSession()`
- `fetchNotifications()`
- `fetchTrash()`

**File Changed**: `src/composables/useSupabaseDatabase.ts`

**SOP**: `docs/sop/SOP-041-mobile-pwa-network-resilience.md`

**Verified**: User confirmed sync errors resolved on mobile PWA.

### BUG-1108: PWA Mobile - Task Input Needs RTL Support (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW (2026-01-30)

**Problem**: Hebrew text in "New Task" modal displays left-to-right instead of right-to-left.

**Root Cause**: Two issues:
1. Textarea/input elements missing `dir` attribute binding
2. CSS missing `text-align: right` for RTL elements (dir attribute sets direction but not alignment)

**Fix Applied**:
1. Added RTL auto-detection computed property (checks first character against Hebrew/Arabic/Persian/Urdu Unicode ranges)
2. Bound `:dir="titleDirection"` to inputs
3. Added CSS: `.task-text-block[dir="rtl"] { text-align: right; }`

**Files Changed**:
- `src/mobile/components/TaskCreateBottomSheet.vue` - `titleDirection` computed + `:dir` binding + CSS
- `src/mobile/components/TaskEditBottomSheet.vue` - `titleDirection` + `descriptionDirection` + CSS

**SOP**: `docs/sop/SOP-042-rtl-support-pattern.md`

**Verification**: User must test on mobile with Hebrew text input - text should align right.

### ~~BUG-1109~~: PWA Mobile - Hebrew Voice Transcription Issues (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-31)

**Problem**: Voice transcription has multiple issues with Hebrew:
1. Transcribes Arabic instead of Hebrew
2. Makes mistakes during regular Hebrew transcription
3. Problems when mixing Hebrew and English in speech

**Solution**: Auto-detection + Arabic retry strategy. Let Whisper auto-detect first, then if result contains Arabic script (likely Hebrew misdetection), retry with `language='he'`. This preserves English and code-switching support while fixing the Arabic confusion.

**Files Added/Modified**:
- `src/utils/scriptDetection.ts` - Script detection utility (Hebrew/Arabic/Latin)
- `src/services/groqWhisper.ts` - Added `transcribeWithRetry()` function
- `src/composables/useGroqWhisper.ts` - Uses new retry function
- `tests/unit/script-detection.test.ts` - 11 unit tests

### BUG-347: FK Constraint Violation on parent_task_id (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P1 | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW (2026-01-21)

**Root Cause**: Tasks saved with `parent_task_id` refs to deleted tasks, no existence validation, race conditions in batch upserts.

**Solution**: Catch-and-retry on FK error code `23503` - clear parent refs and retry once. Applied in `useSupabaseDatabase.ts` (`saveTask()`, `saveTasks()`).

**Problem**: When Vite server disconnects or dynamic imports fail, Vue Router throws uncaught `TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module` with no graceful error handling.

**Observed Behavior**:
1. `[vite] server connection lost. Polling for restart...`
2. User navigates to a route (e.g., Board view)
3. `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`
4. `TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module` (uncaught)
5. `[Vue Router warn]: uncaught error during route navigation`
6. Navigation fails silently - no user feedback

**Expected Behavior**: Show error boundary/fallback UI when route modules fail to load, with "Reload" button option.

**Fix Approach**:
1. Add global error handler for dynamic import failures in `router/index.ts`
2. Create `ErrorBoundary.vue` component for route-level errors
3. Add retry logic with exponential backoff for failed imports

**Files**: `src/router/index.ts`, `src/components/ErrorBoundary.vue` (CREATE), `src/App.vue`

### ~~BUG-1100~~: Shift+G Creates Group While Typing in Modals (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-27)

**Problem**: Canvas hotkey Shift+G (create group) triggered even when user was typing in the Create Task modal, preventing input of capital "G".

**Fix Applied**: Added input protection at the start of `handleKeyDown()` in `src/composables/canvas/useCanvasHotkeys.ts`:
- Checks for `INPUT`, `TEXTAREA`, `contentEditable` elements
- Checks for modal containers (`[role="dialog"]`, `.modal`, `.n-modal`, `.n-dialog`)
- Returns early to allow normal typing when in these contexts

**File Changed**: `src/composables/canvas/useCanvasHotkeys.ts`

| `tasks.test.ts` | Update default project ID |
| `repro-bug-030.test.ts` | Fix filter logic |

---

### BUG-1120: Test Environment localStorage Not Available (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED

`tests/repro-bug-030.test.ts` fails with localStorage issue - test environment doesn't have localStorage mocked/available. This is a test infrastructure issue, not a code bug.

**Fix**: Add localStorage mock to Vitest setup or the specific test file.

---

### ~~BUG-025~~: Unrelated Groups Move with Parent (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE

Dragging a group causes unrelated groups to move. Location: `useCanvasDragDrop.ts` parentGroupId logic.

**Resolution** (verified Jan 2026):
- Original `useCanvasDragDrop.ts` was refactored into `useCanvasInteractions.ts`
- `collectDescendantGroups()` function now properly filters by `parentGroupId === rootId`
- Only actual descendants are collected and synced on group drag
- Cycle protection added via `visited` Set
- Unrelated groups are never included in descendant collection

### ~~TASK-1114~~: Tauri Auto-Update from GitHub Releases (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-30)

**Request**: Enable Tauri app to automatically update when new versions are pushed to GitHub releases.

**Implementation**:
1. Added `tauri-plugin-updater` to Cargo.toml
2. Registered updater plugin in `lib.rs`
3. Added `updater:default` capability for update permissions
4. Enhanced `useTauriUpdater.ts` composable with check/download/install flow
5. Created `TauriUpdateNotification.vue` component with glass morphism styling
6. Integrated update banner in `App.vue` (Tauri-only, shows when update available)

**Files Changed**: `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`, `src/composables/useTauriUpdater.ts`, `src/components/common/TauriUpdateNotification.vue`, `src/App.vue`

**Testing**: Requires GitHub release with higher version number to trigger update flow

---

### ~~BUG-1115~~: Tauri App Performance is Slow (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-31)

**Problem**: Tauri desktop app feels sluggish compared to web version.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. ✅ **Missing release profile optimizations** - FIXED
2. ✅ **DevTools feature always enabled** - FIXED (dev-only now)
3. ⚠️ **10 Tauri plugins loaded** - Minor impact, not addressed
4. ✅ Logging gated by `debug_assertions` - Already good
5. ✅ CSP is null (not blocking) - Already good

**Fix Applied**:
1. Added `[profile.release]` to Cargo.toml:
   - `lto = true` (Link-Time Optimization)
   - `codegen-units = 1` (better optimization)
   - `strip = true` (smaller binary)
   - `opt-level = 3` (max optimization)
   - `panic = "abort"` (no unwinding overhead)
2. Made devtools conditional via `[features]` section
3. Added `"features": ["devtools"]` to tauri.conf.json (dev builds only)

**Expected Improvement**: 10-30% faster startup, smaller binary, snappier UI

**Files Changed**: `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`

**Verification**: User must build release (`npm run tauri build`) and compare performance

---

### ~~BUG-1116~~: Tauri Mouse Offset During Drag (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-31)

**Problem**: When dragging tasks in Tauri app on Linux, there was visible lag - the task would animate to cursor position instead of snapping instantly.

**Root Cause**: CSS transitions on `transform` property in `canvas-view-overrides.css` (line 137) were causing the dragged node to animate to cursor position.

**Fix Applied** (`src/assets/vue-flow-overrides.css`):
```css
.vue-flow__node.dragging,
.vue-flow__node.dragging * {
    transition: none !important;
    animation: none !important;
}
```

**Additional Changes**:
- Added `isLinuxTauri()`, `getPlatformDiagnostics()`, `getLinuxTauriScaleFactor()` utilities in `src/utils/contextMenuCoordinates.ts`
- Added diagnostic logging in `useCanvasInteractions.ts` for future debugging

### ~~BUG-1195~~: Pomoflow Widget syncTimer polls every 2s even when idle (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-05)

**Problem**: The KDE Pomoflow widget's syncTimer fires HTTP requests every 2 seconds unconditionally when authenticated, even with no active timer session. This wastes bandwidth and battery.

**File**: `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.pomoflow.widget/contents/ui/main.qml` (line ~1204)

**Fix Applied**: Changed `interval: 2000` to `interval: root.hasActiveSession ? 2000 : 30000` for adaptive polling.

---

### ~~BUG-1196~~: Pomoflow Widget filterMenu/sortMenu undefined references (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-05)

**Problem**: `onExpandedChanged` handler references `filterMenu` and `sortMenu` objects that don't exist in the QML, causing runtime errors when the popup closes.

**File**: `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.pomoflow.widget/contents/ui/main.qml` (line ~1853)

**Fix Applied**: Added `typeof` and truthiness guards before accessing menu properties.

---

### ~~BUG-1295~~: Canvas Ctrl+Click Toggle Selection Broken (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-10)

**Problem**: Ctrl+Click on canvas tasks didn't toggle individual selection when multiple tasks were selected.

**Root Cause**: Vue Flow's `nodesselection-rect` overlay (`pointer-events: all`) blocked clicks from reaching TaskNode components. Previous capture-phase mousedown interceptor worked for Shift but not Ctrl because Vue Flow uses `pointerdown` events (which fire before mousedown).

**Fix**: 3-layer approach:
1. `useCanvasSelection.ts`: keydown/keyup listeners toggle `pointer-events: none` on `.vue-flow__nodesselection-rect` when Ctrl/Meta/Shift held
2. `useTaskNodeActions.ts`: New `handlePointerDown` handler stops pointerdown propagation to prevent Vue Flow's internal selection handling
3. `TaskNode.vue`: Wired `@pointerdown="handlePointerDown"` on root div

**Files**: `src/composables/canvas/useCanvasSelection.ts`, `src/composables/canvas/node/useTaskNodeActions.ts`, `src/components/canvas/TaskNode.vue`

## Active Tasks (IN PROGRESS)

### TASK-1060: Infrastructure & E2E Sync Stability (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Started: 2026-01-24)

**Problem**: Intermittent sync failures across Web, Tauri, PWA, KDE Widget - 0 tasks shown, WebSocket 403 errors, SIGTERM exits.

**Root Causes Found**:
1. CI/CD `deploy.yml` was killing System Caddy, starting Docker Caddy (conflict)
2. SWR cache not invalidated on auth change (fixed in BUG-1056)
3. Silent session refresh failure didn't set error state (fixed 2026-01-30)
4. No retry on initial database load (fixed 2026-01-30)
5. Fetch functions started before auth ready (fixed 2026-01-30)
6. Tauri `.expect()` panic on startup failure (fixed 2026-01-30)
7. Circular dependency causing TDZ error in production build (BUG-1099, fixed 2026-01-30)

**Infrastructure Fixes Applied** (2026-01-24):
- Docker stack stopped, System Caddy re-enabled
- Fixed `deploy.yml` - static files only, graceful Caddy reload

**Phase 2 Fixes Applied** (2026-01-30):
- Mark `initializationFailed` when session refresh fails (`auth.ts`)
- Add retry wrapper (3x with backoff) for initial database load (`useAppInitialization.ts`)
- Add auth initialization guard to `fetchTasks`, `fetchProjects`, `fetchGroups` (`useSupabaseDatabase.ts`)

**Phase 3 Fixes Applied** (2026-01-30):
- Replace `.expect()` panic with graceful error handling + helpful messages (`lib.rs`)

**Phase 4 Audit Findings** (2026-01-30):
- Offline database (`useOfflineDatabase.ts`) is a shell - NOT integrated with Supabase
- Notification fallback lacks action buttons when SW unavailable
- SWR cache 3s stale window acceptable but may cause brief position flash
- Added Caddy systemd auto-restart config

**Remaining Phases** (condensed):
- [ ] Phase 1.3: Verify JWT keys in `/opt/supabase/docker/.env` (requires VPS SSH)
- [x] Phase 2: Auth flow audit + fixes (DONE 2026-01-30)
- [x] Phase 3: Tauri debug + panic fix (DONE 2026-01-30)
- [x] Phase 4: PWA service worker audit (DONE 2026-01-30 - offline DB gap identified)
- [x] Phase 5: KDE widget token refresh on startup (DONE 2026-01-31 - was loading expired tokens)
- [ ] Phase 6: Cross-platform E2E matrix test (requires testing)

**Success Criteria**: Caddy 24h+ uptime, no 0-task loads, Tauri no SIGTERM, PWA overnight persistence.

**Key Files**: `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`, `src/stores/auth.ts`, `src/composables/useSupabaseDatabase.ts`, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `kde-widget/package/contents/ui/main.qml`

### TASK-1214: Child Groups Inherit Parent Group Properties (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Started: 2026-02-06)

**Problem**: When dropping a task into a nested child group, the task only inherits properties from the immediate child group. Parent group properties (especially dates like "Today") are NOT inherited.

**Expected Behavior**: Task dropped into child group → inherits date from parent group + any properties from child group (child overrides parent for conflicts).

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Added `getParentChain()` utility in `storeHelpers.ts` - traverses from child to parent groups
2. Modified `getSectionProperties()` to traverse parent chain and merge properties (root → child order)
3. Updated `useCanvasInteractions.ts` to pass `allGroups` for inheritance

**Current Status**: Enhanced debug logging added to diagnose why inheritance isn't working in all cases. Testing in progress.

**Key Files**:
- `src/utils/canvas/storeHelpers.ts` - `getParentChain()` function
- `src/composables/canvas/useCanvasSectionProperties.ts` - Parent chain traversal
- `src/composables/canvas/useCanvasInteractions.ts` - Passes allGroups to enable inheritance

**Changes Made**:
- [x] Added `currentTaskId` property for active timer task
- [x] Increased task row height (44-64px dynamic)
- [x] Added 2-line text wrap with RTL support
- [x] Added active task highlight (accent border + glow + pulse)
- [x] Added chronometer icon + bold text for active task

**Verified**: Plasma restarted, widget displays correctly.

**File**: `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.pomoflow.widget/contents/ui/main.qml`

---

### ~~TASK-1121~~: QuickTaskCreateModal UI/UX Redesign (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-02)

**Problem**: Modal had inconsistent styling - inputs had no visible borders, multiple different border-radii (6px/8px/16px), hardcoded rgba colors violating design token system, low placeholder contrast failing WCAG, and inconsistent visual hierarchy between sections.

**Changes Made**:
- Unified all inputs with glass container styling (visible borders + rounded corners)
- Standardized ALL border-radii to `var(--radius-md)` (8px)
- Replaced 10+ hardcoded rgba() colors with `--purple-*` and `--glass-*` tokens
- Fixed placeholder contrast (opacity 0.5 → 0.8, color to `--text-tertiary`)
- Removed "SCHEDULE" / "DETAILS" section labels (visual noise)
- Progressive voice disclosure (mic button fades in on focus/hover)
- RTL support with logical CSS properties (`inset-inline-start`, etc.)
- Removed purple gradient box around Schedule section (equal visual weight)

**Files**: `src/components/tasks/QuickTaskCreateModal.vue`

**Pending Fixes**: 4 (settling flag timing), 5 (remove tolerance snapping), 8 (zombie prevention).

---

### TASK-241: Position Versioning & Conflict Detection (✅ Phase 1 COMPLETE)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: ✅ Phase 1 COMPLETE

**Phase 1 Done**:
- [x] SQL migration for `position_version` auto-increment triggers
- [x] `src/utils/canvas/coordinates.ts` - position conversion source of truth
- [x] `src/composables/canvas/useCanvasOperationState.ts` - state machine

**Phase 2 Pending**:
- [ ] Run SQL migration in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] Wire state machine into `useCanvasOrchestrator`
- [ ] Test: drag → refresh → verify position persists

### ~~INQUIRY-1112~~: Supabase Function Search Path Mutable Warnings (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-30)

**Problem**: Supabase Security Advisor shows 7 warnings for "Function Search Path Mutable" on database functions:
- `public.check_task_ids_availability`
- `public.create_task_tombstone`
- `public.safe_create_task`
- `public.update_updated_at_column`
- `public.increment_task_position_version`
- `public.increment_group_position_version`
- `public.cleanup_expired_tombstones`

**Conclusion**: LOW PRIORITY - Safe to ignore for personal productivity app.
- RLS is enabled (users can only access their own data)
- Not multi-tenant (no shared database access)
- Attack requires database superuser access (which would bypass all security anyway)
- Fix is simple if desired later: Add `SET search_path = public` to each function

### ~~INQUIRY-1113~~: Terminal UI Task Picker for Claude Code (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P3-LOW | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-30)

**Question**: Can we build an interactive terminal app that works within Claude Code to show scrollable/clickable task options?

**Answer**: YES - Prototype built and working at `tools/task-picker/`

**Research Findings**:
| Framework | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|-----------|------|------|---------|
| **Ink v6 + @inkjs/ui** | Modern, maintained, used by Claude Code itself | Select has no built-in search | ✅ CHOSEN |
| **ink-select-input v6** | Lightweight, j/k navigation | No search, basic | Good alternative |
| **ink-search-select** | Has incremental search | Uses old Ink v2.x (outdated) | ❌ Outdated |
| **Bubbletea** | Very polished, great ecosystem | Go-only (not Node.js) | N/A for this project |

**Implementation**:
- Built with: `ink` v5 + `@inkjs/ui` v2 + `tsx` runtime
- Features: Filter by type, show/hide done, j/k navigation, Enter to select
- Non-interactive mode: `--list` flag for CI/scripting
- Location: `tools/task-picker/index.tsx`

**Usage**:

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-02)

**Feature**: Added "Send to Canvas" button to inbox task cards. When clicked, tasks are automatically placed in matching Smart Groups based on their due date:
- Tasks with due dates are placed in matching groups (Today, Tomorrow, This Week, day-of-week)
- Tasks without due dates default to the Today group
- Supports multi-select batch operations for sending multiple tasks at once

**Implementation**:
- [x] NEW: `src/composables/canvas/useSmartGroupMatcher.ts` - Smart group matching logic
- [x] Modified: `src/composables/inbox/useUnifiedInboxActions.ts` - Action handler for send to canvas
- [x] Modified: `src/components/inbox/unified/UnifiedInboxTaskCard.vue` - Button UI in task cards
- [x] Modified: `src/components/inbox/unified/UnifiedInboxList.vue` - Multi-select support

### ~~TASK-1111~~: Sync Design Tokens with KDE Widget Dropdowns (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-30)

**Problem**: KDE Plasma widget dropdowns (task filter, sort) used default Qt styling instead of matching the main app's glass morphism design.

**Solution**: Styled QQC2.ComboBox components in the KDE widget with custom glass morphism appearance matching design tokens.

**Implemented**:
- [x] Custom background with purple-tinted glass morphism (`rgba(28, 25, 45, 0.95)`)
- [x] Subtle white border with hover state (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12)`)
- [x] Custom popup with rounded corners and glass styling
- [x] Hover highlight with teal accent color
- [x] Custom chevron indicator

**File**: `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.pomoflow.widget/contents/ui/main.qml`

- Uses `--external-ref` for cross-referencing (TASK-123 → flow-state-abc)
- Status mapping: PLANNED→open, IN PROGRESS→in_progress, DONE→closed
- Priority mapping: P0-P4 → 0-4
- Idempotent sync (145 tasks synced, detects unchanged)

**Verification**:
- `bd ready` shows prioritized unblocked tasks
- `bd show <id> --json` confirms external_ref mapping
- `npm run mp:sync:dry` previews changes

### TASK-1246: Collapse Sidebar Group Filters into Dropdown (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P0 | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Problem**: The sidebar smart view area displays all groups (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Today, Tomorrow, New Group, All) with counts in a flat grid that clutters the UI, especially when many groups exist.

**Solution**: Collapse group filters into an existing dropdown or a new collapsible section so they don't show all the time. Keep the primary smart views (Today, This Week, All Active, Inbox) visible, but move the day-of-week groups and custom groups behind a dropdown/toggle.

**Files**:
- `src/layouts/AppSidebar.vue` — Main sidebar with smart view grid
- `src/components/layout/SidebarSmartItem.vue` — Individual filter item component

### TASK-1248: Design Token Audit & Cleanup (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED (2026-02-08)

**Problem**: ~3,000 hardcoded CSS values across ~130 `.vue` and `.css` files bypass the design token system (`src/assets/design-tokens.css`). This undermines theme consistency, makes future theming/light-mode impossible, and creates maintenance debt.

**Scan Results** (Feb 8, 2026):
| Violation Type | Occurrences | Files |
|---|---|---|
| Hardcoded `rgba()`/`rgb()` | ~1,404 | 128 |
| Hardcoded hex colors | ~488 | 75 |
| Hardcoded `box-shadow` | ~411 | 127 |
| Hardcoded `padding`/`margin`/`gap` px | ~181 | 25+ |
| Hardcoded `font-size` px | ~121 | 20 |
| Hardcoded `border-radius` px | ~92 | 31 |

**Phased Plan** (by domain, priority order):

| Phase | Domain | Files | Est. Violations | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mobile views (`mobile/`) | ~10 | ~500 | Highest — worst offender area |
| 2 | AI Chat (`ai/`) | 2 | ~250 | High — AIChatPanel + ChatMessage |
| 3 | Gamification (`gamification/`) | ~20 | ~400 | Medium — cyber components |
| 4 | Canvas nodes (`canvas/`) | ~10 | ~200 | Medium — TaskNode, GroupNode |
| 5 | Task components (`tasks/`) | ~10 | ~150 | Medium — TaskRow, drag handles |
| 6 | CSS files (non-token) | 7 | ~300 | Lower — global overrides |
| 7 | Remaining (base, calendar, layout, etc.) | ~60 | ~200 | Lowest — mostly clean |

**Rules**:
- Replace hardcoded values with existing tokens from `design-tokens.css`
- If no suitable token exists, add a new semantic token first
- Skip intentional hardcoded values (SVG attributes, keyframe animations, third-party overrides)
- Each phase = one PR, tests must pass

### TASK-1249: Codebase Hygiene Audit — Placeholders, Hardcoded Values, Debug Leftovers (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P0 | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-08)

**Summary**: Comprehensive 7-agent audit found 10 CRITICAL, 34 MEDIUM, 29 LOW issues across placeholders, hardcoded values, demo content, debug leftovers, design token violations, AI config, and metadata.

**Sub-Tasks (ordered by priority)**:

#### P0 — Security & Broken Functionality
- [x] **~~TASK-1250~~**: ✅ Fix API key storage — removed plaintext localStorage inputs since proxy handles keys server-side (`AIChatPanel.vue`)
- [x] **~~TASK-1251~~**: ✅ Fix direct API calls bypassing proxy — route model-listing through `aiChatProxy.ts` instead of direct fetch to groq.com/openrouter.ai (`AIChatPanel.vue:275,290`)
- [x] **~~TASK-1252~~**: ✅ Remove or gate `/keyboard-test` debug route — ships without auth, exposes task creation/deletion debug panel (`router/index.ts:105-108`)
- [x] **~~TASK-1253~~**: ✅ Gate `window.__flowstate_tauri_debug` behind `import.meta.env.DEV` (`useTauriDebug.ts:270-276`)

#### P2 — Code Quality & Design System
- [ ] **TASK-1266**: CSS design token migration — top 10 offending files (1,420 raw rgba + 434 hex violations across 129 files). ~305 hardcoded values migrated in 20+ files (DoneToggleVisuals, GamificationPanel, ShopModal, BossFightPanel, ChallengeCard, ChallengeComplete, AchievementBadge, AchievementToast, AchievementsModal, CorruptionOverlay, DailyChallengesPanel, LevelBadge, StreakCounter, XpBar, TaskCreateBottomSheet, TaskEditBottomSheet, CalendarTaskCard, TauriUpdateNotification, ARIAMessage, etc.). Remaining violations still exist.
- [x] **~~TASK-1267~~**: ✅ Standardize localStorage key prefixes — settings.ts migrated with migration logic for old keys
- [x] **~~TASK-1268~~**: ✅ Extract magic timeout numbers to named constants — created `src/config/timing.ts` with PENDING_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS, DRAG_SETTLE_TIMEOUT_MS, FILE_DIALOG_TIMEOUT_MS, CROSS_TAB_DEDUP_TIMEOUT_MS, RESIZE_SETTLE_TIMEOUT_MS
- [x] **~~TASK-1269~~**: ✅ Create centralized `src/config/urls.ts` — EXTERNAL_URLS with DiceBear, GitHub, production site, Storybook dev
- [x] **~~TASK-1270~~**: ✅ Fix hardcoded i18n defaults — updated ui.ts comment, wrapped password strength labels in `t()` calls, added en/he translations

- [x] **~~TASK-1276~~**: ✅ Remove Storybook `title: 'PLACEHOLDER'` duplicate key (`OverflowTooltip.stories.ts:4`)
- [x] **~~TASK-1277~~**: ✅ Standardize z-index usage — replaced ~60 hardcoded values across 50 files with `var(--z-*)` tokens (dropdown, modal, popover, tooltip layers)
- [x] **~~TASK-1278~~**: ✅ Standardize font-size usage — replaced ~100 hardcoded px/rem values across 32 files with `var(--text-*)` tokens
- [x] **~~TASK-1279~~**: ✅ Add missing package.json metadata — homepage, repository, bugs fields
- [x] **~~TASK-1280~~**: ✅ Add copyright field to Tauri bundle config (`tauri.conf.json`)

## Planned Tasks (NEXT/BACKLOG)

### INQUIRY-1249: WhatsApp Bot Integration for Task Creation via WAHA + Groq (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED (2026-02-10)

**Progress (2026-02-10):** Researched WhatsApp bot options (NanoClaw, WAHA, Baileys, Twilio). Decided on WAHA + Groq + Oracle Cloud free tier stack. $0/month total cost. Dedicated WhatsApp number for zero ban risk.

**Concept**: WhatsApp bot that receives forwarded messages, parses them with AI, and creates tasks in FlowState automatically.

**Research Findings**:
- **WAHA** (WhatsApp HTTP API): Self-hosted Docker container, REST API, free core tier, 6.1k GitHub stars
- **Groq** (Llama 3.3 70B): Free AI parsing — extracts title, priority, due date from natural language
- **Supabase REST API**: Direct task insertion into existing FlowState database
- **Oracle Cloud free tier**: Hosting (ARM 4 OCPU / 24GB RAM — more than enough)
- **Dedicated WhatsApp number**: Eliminates ban risk on personal account

**Proposed Architecture**:
```
WhatsApp (dedicated number) → WAHA (Docker, Oracle Cloud) → Webhook → Bot (Node.js)
                                                                          ↓
                                                                   Groq API (free)
                                                                          ↓
                                                                   Supabase REST → FlowState
```

**Estimated Cost**: $0/month (all free tiers)

**Alternatives Evaluated**:
- NanoClaw: Powerful but requires Claude API ($), overkill for task parsing
- Baileys direct: Works but WAHA provides better REST abstraction + anti-ban tools
- Twilio: Official but $0.005/msg, unnecessary for personal use

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Set up Oracle Cloud free tier VM
- [ ] Deploy WAHA Docker container with NOWEB engine
- [ ] Build webhook handler (Node.js/TypeScript, ~200 LOC)
- [ ] Integrate Groq for message parsing
- [ ] Connect to FlowState Supabase via REST API
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow

### FEATURE-1248: Quick Tasks - Pinned & Frequent Task Shortcuts (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-08)

**Problem**: Selecting a task to work on requires sifting through the full task list every time. For recurring work (e.g., "flow-state development" done daily), this friction adds up.

**Feature**: A "Quick Tasks" system that surfaces the most relevant tasks for one-click selection — powered by two sources:

**1. Auto-detected frequent tasks** (smart):
- SQL aggregation groups completed tasks by title, ranks by frequency
- Supabase RPC function: `get_common_task_titles(user_id, limit)` queries task history
- Tasks you create repeatedly float to the top automatically

**2. Manually pinned tasks** (user-controlled):
- New `pinned_tasks` table for permanent recurring shortcuts
- User can pin/unpin from task context menu or Quick Tasks panel
- Pinned tasks always appear at top, regardless of frequency

**Surfaces in**:
- **Main app**: Quick Task selector (timer area or floating panel) with pin/unpin UI
- **KDE widget**: ComboBox dropdown, filtered by widget config, calls same Supabase RPC

**Implementation Plan**:

*Database (Supabase):*
- [x] `pinned_tasks` table (id, user_id, title, description, project_id, priority, sort_order, created_at) ✅
- [ ] RPC function `get_quick_tasks()` — returns pinned + top N frequent tasks, merged and deduplicated (skipped — client-side merge used instead)

*Main App:*
- [x] `useQuickTasks.ts` composable — fetches pins from Supabase, merges with frequent tasks client-side ✅
- [x] Quick Task selector UI component (`QuickTaskDropdown.vue` in timer area) ✅
- [x] Pin/unpin action in task context menu (`MoreSubmenu.vue` + `TaskContextMenu.vue`) ✅
- [x] Quick-add input for pinning new tasks directly from dropdown ✅
- [ ] Respect active filters (project, status, priority)

**Progress (2026-02-08):** Main app implementation complete — `pinned_tasks` table with RLS applied to local + VPS, composable, dropdown component with quick-add, context menu pin action. Content cutoff fix applied. Needs version bump + deploy. KDE widget integration still pending (separate repo).

*KDE Widget (pomoflow-kde repo):*
- [ ] ComboBox dropdown querying `pinned_tasks` via PostgREST REST API
- [ ] Widget config filters affect results
- [ ] Separate refresh timer (60s) from timer poll (2s)

**Dependencies**: None — standalone feature

### TASK-1118: Test Suite Cleanup - Reduce 615 Tests to ~100 Essential (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P3 | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED

**Problem**: Test suite has grown to 615 tests, many are one-off debug tests that were never cleaned up. This adds maintenance burden and slows test runs.

**Cleanup Targets**:
- `debug-*.spec.ts` - One-off debugging tests
- `repro_*.spec.ts` - Bug reproduction tests (bugs already fixed)
- `quick-*.spec.ts` - Quick check scripts
- `inspect-*.spec.ts` - Visual inspection tests
- `verify-*.spec.ts` - One-time verification tests

**Keep (Essential Tests)**:
- Data persistence / Supabase sync tests
- Auth flow tests
- Known bug regression tests
- Stress tests (`tests/stress/`)
- Safety tests (`tests/safety/`)
- Core component integration tests

**Target**: ~100 essential tests with fast execution (<30s)

### ~~TASK-1104~~: Enhanced Task Filtering and Grouping Options (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-29)

Replaced status-based filters with flexible filtering and grouping system in Mobile Inbox and Today views.

**Implemented**:
- **Time filters**: All, Due Today, Due This Week, Overdue (Inbox)
- **Grouping options**: None, By Date, By Project, By Priority
- **Filter dropdowns**: Project filter, Priority filter (Today view)
- **Hide Done toggle**: Show/hide completed tasks

**Files Modified**: `src/mobile/views/MobileInboxView.vue`, `src/mobile/views/MobileTodayView.vue`

---

### ~~TASK-1102~~: Calendar View Start on Current Day with Time Scroll (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: ✅ DONE

When entering calendar view: default to current day's date and auto-scroll to current time position.

**Solution**: Changed `useCalendarNavigation.ts` to use a regular `ref` instead of `useStorage` for the current date. This ensures each time the CalendarView component mounts, it starts fresh at today's date. The existing `scrollToCurrentTime()` call in `onMounted` handles scrolling to current time.

**Files Modified**: `src/composables/calendar/useCalendarNavigation.ts`

---

### ~~TASK-1002~~: Voice Transcription to Task (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1 | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-31)

Record audio → transcription API (Whisper/Deepgram) → create task. Mobile-first UX.

**Implementation Complete**:
- Groq Whisper API service (`src/services/groqWhisper.ts`)
- Recording composable (`src/composables/useGroqWhisper.ts`)
- NLP parser with Hebrew+English support (`src/composables/useVoiceTaskParser.ts`)
- Confirmation UI with RTL support (`src/mobile/components/VoiceTaskConfirmation.vue`)
- Mobile integration (`src/mobile/components/TaskCreateBottomSheet.vue`)

---

### ~~TASK-1110~~: PWA Mobile - Add Re-Record Option in Task Creation (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-31)

**Feature**: Add ability to re-record voice input from the task creation modal. Currently no way to redo a recording once made.

**Implementation**:
- Desktop: Added re-record props and button to `VoiceTaskConfirmation.vue`
- Mobile: Added re-record button to `TaskCreateBottomSheet.vue`
- Button shows "Record" when empty, "Re-record" when has existing text
- Fixed bug where button disappeared when clearing text

**Related**: TASK-1002, FEATURE-1023

---

### FEATURE-1111: PWA Mobile - Batch Voice Recording for Multiple Tasks (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED

**Feature**: Record multiple tasks in sequence without leaving the creation flow.

**Proposed UX**:
1. "Record another task" button after recording
2. Approve current recording → record next
3. See all previous recordings in same panel
4. "Add all" button to create all recorded tasks at once

**Needs**: UX design/breakdown session before implementation

**Related**: TASK-1002, TASK-1110, FEATURE-1023

---

### TASK-359: Quick Add + Sort Feature (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW

Batch capture mode: `Ctrl+.` opens Quick Capture modal, type titles + Enter, Tab to sort phase, 1-9 assigns project.

**Files**: `src/composables/useQuickCapture.ts`, `src/components/quicksort/QuickCaptureModal.vue`

---

### TASK-1117: Enhance Quick Sort UX on Mobile (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-01-30)

**Problem**: Mobile Quick Sort has unclear UX hierarchy and confusing swipe interactions:
1. Sliding right opens Quick Edit modal instead of sorting
2. Project selection is required before sorting happens
3. The process flow is not intuitive - users don't understand the hierarchy

**Implementation (Phase 1 Complete)**:
- [x] Swipe Right = Directly opens project picker (instant categorization)
- [x] Swipe Left = Mark Done instantly (no confirmation delay)
- [x] "Keep in Inbox" option allows sorting without project assignment
- [x] Process flow indicator shows hierarchy: Swipe → Assign → Sorted!
- [x] Updated swipe indicators: green "Done!" (left), teal "Assign" (right)
- [x] 4 action buttons in thumb zone: Done, Assign, Skip, Delete
- [ ] User testing and feedback

**Related**: TASK-359 (Quick Add + Sort desktop), FEATURE-1023 (Voice Input)

**Files Modified**: `src/mobile/views/MobileQuickSortView.vue`

---

### FEATURE-1048: Canvas Auto-Rotating Day Groups (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED

User-triggered rotation of day groups (Mon-Sun) with midnight notification.

**Key Files**: `src/composables/canvas/useDayGroupRotation.ts` (CREATE), `src/components/canvas/DayRotationBanner.vue` (CREATE)

---

### ~~FEATURE-1023~~: Voice Input - Transcription + Task Extraction (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-01-30)

Voice input → Web Speech API / Whisper → NLP extracts task properties (priority, due date). Supports Hebrew + English.

**Implementation**:
- `useSpeechRecognition.ts` - Web Speech API with language auto-detect
- `useWhisperSpeech.ts` - Groq Whisper fallback (12x cheaper than OpenAI)
- `useVoiceNLPParser.ts` - Extracts title, due date, priority from natural language
- Mic button in Mobile Inbox with AI/Browser mode toggle
- Integrated NLP parsing in `TaskCreateBottomSheet.vue`

**Completed Subtasks**: ~~TASK-1024~~ (Web Speech API), ~~TASK-1025~~ (Mic Button), ~~TASK-1026~~ (NLP Parser), ~~TASK-1027~~ (Commands), ~~TASK-1028~~ (Confirmation UI), ~~TASK-1029~~ (Whisper Fallback)

**Known Issues**: ~~BUG-1109~~ (Hebrew voice transcription - FIXED via Arabic retry)

---

### TASK-1119: Remove Web Speech API - Use Whisper Only (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P3-LOW | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW

**Rationale**: Web Speech API has poor quality compared to Whisper:
- Browser-dependent (different results on Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
- Poor Hebrew support
- No mixed-language (code-switching) support
- Requires manual language selection

**Scope**: Mobile only (desktop components still use browser speech as fallback)

**Changes Made**:
1. Removed Browser/AI mode toggle from MobileInboxView
2. Made Whisper (via Groq) the only voice input method for mobile
3. Simplified voice UI - single mic button, no mode selection
4. Simplified cancelVoice to Whisper-only
5. Removed all `voiceMode`, `voiceLanguage`, `toggleVoiceMode` references

**Files Modified**:
- `src/mobile/views/MobileInboxView.vue` - Whisper-only voice UI

**Note**: `useSpeechRecognition.ts` kept for desktop components (UnifiedInboxInput, QuickCaptureTab, AppSidebar)

**Related**: ~~FEATURE-1023~~, ~~BUG-1109~~, ~~TASK-1131~~

---

### TASK-1131: Offline Voice Queue - Save & Retry When Online (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW

**Problem**: With Whisper-only voice input (TASK-1119), offline recording fails silently.

**Solution**: Save audio blob to IndexedDB, show badge, auto-transcribe when back online.

**Implementation Complete**:
1. Created `useOfflineVoiceQueue.ts` composable
   - Saves audio blob to IndexedDB when offline
   - Uses VueUse `useOnline()` for connectivity detection
   - Watches online status and processes queue when reconnected
   - Auto-retries failed transcriptions (max 3 attempts)
2. Modified `useWhisperSpeech.ts`:
   - Added `onOfflineRecord` callback option
   - Added `isQueued` status for UI feedback
   - Exposed `isOnline` state
3. Updated `MobileInboxView.vue`:
   - Badge on mic button shows pending count
   - Offline indicator when not connected
   - Voice feedback shows "Saved offline" status
   - Haptic feedback on queue save

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `src/composables/useOfflineVoiceQueue.ts` (CREATE) - IndexedDB queue management
- `src/composables/useWhisperSpeech.ts` (MODIFY) - Offline callback support
- `src/mobile/views/MobileInboxView.vue` (MODIFY) - UI integration

**Depends On**: ~~TASK-1119~~ (Whisper-only simplification) ✅

**Effort**: ~2-3 hours

---

| TASK-364 | WebSocket stability (disconnect, reconnect, subscribe cycles) |
| TASK-366 | Redundancy assessment (SPOF mapping, fallback testing) |

---

### FEATURE-1198: Task Image Attachments with Cloud Storage and Compression (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED

**Feature**: Allow users to attach images to tasks. Images should be compressed client-side before upload to reduce storage. Optionally store images in Google Drive or Dropbox so the VPS doesn't run out of disk space.

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Image upload UI in task editor (drag-drop + file picker)
- [ ] Client-side image compression before upload (e.g., browser-image-compression)
- [ ] Cloud storage integration (Google Drive and/or Dropbox) to offload VPS storage
- [ ] Fallback to Supabase Storage if no cloud provider configured
- [ ] Image preview/gallery in task detail view
- [ ] Max file size limit and format validation

**Investigation Needed**:
- Google Drive API vs Dropbox API for image storage
- Supabase Storage bucket as default backend
- Compression ratio targets (quality vs size tradeoff)
- Tauri desktop: local file access vs cloud sync

---

### BUG-1199: Canvas Inbox Right-Click Acts as Ctrl+Click (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW (2026-02-06)

**Problem**: Right-clicking on a task in the canvas inbox behaves as if Ctrl+Click was pressed (multi-select behavior) instead of opening a context menu or doing nothing.

**Root Cause**: The native `@click` event fires for ALL mouse buttons (left=0, right=2). When right-clicking, `@click` fires first (running selection logic), then `@contextmenu` fires. Canvas nodes don't have this issue because Vue Flow's `@node-click` filters by button internally.

**Fix Applied**: Added `event.button !== 0` early return in `handleTaskClick()` so only left-clicks trigger selection logic. Right-clicks now only fire the `@contextmenu` handler.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/composables/inbox/useUnifiedInboxActions.ts` - Added button check (1 line)

---

### FEATURE-1200: Quick Add Full RTL Support + Auto-Expand for Long Tasks (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED

**Feature**: Two improvements to the Quick Add input in the main sidebar:

1. **Full RTL support**: The quick add input should properly support RTL text (Hebrew). Text direction should auto-detect or follow app locale.
2. **Auto-expand to fullscreen**: When typing a long task title that exceeds the input width, automatically open a fullscreen task creator popup/modal so the user has more space to write.

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Add `dir="auto"` or RTL detection to quick add input
- [ ] RTL-aware placeholder text and icons
- [ ] Character/width threshold to trigger fullscreen expansion
- [ ] Smooth transition from inline input to fullscreen modal
- [ ] Carry over typed text to the fullscreen creator
- [ ] Fullscreen creator should also be fully RTL-aware

**Files to Investigate**:
- Quick add component in sidebar
- `TaskEditModal.vue` or equivalent fullscreen creator

---

### FEATURE-1201: Intro/Onboarding Page for Guest and Signed-In Users (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED

**Feature**: Add an intro/onboarding page when users first enter the app, both in guest mode and after signing in. Need to decide what content belongs on each.

**Design Decisions Needed**:
- [ ] What to show guest users (feature highlights, sign-up CTA, quick tour?)
- [ ] What to show signed-in users on first visit (workspace setup, quick tutorial, keyboard shortcuts?)
- [ ] Should it be a single splash page, multi-step wizard, or dismissable overlay?
- [ ] Should it reappear after major updates?

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Guest mode intro: explain app capabilities, encourage sign-up
- [ ] Signed-in intro: workspace orientation, key features walkthrough
- [ ] "Don't show again" option
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Matches glass morphism design system

---

**Supabase Setup**:
- Enable Google provider in Supabase Auth settings
- Configure OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console
- Set redirect URLs for both PWA and Tauri

### TASK-1283: Google Calendar Plugin — Calendar View Integration (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P1 | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED | **Blocked By**: FEATURE-1202

**Feature**: Add a plugin/settings option to connect Google Calendar. Once connected, display Google Calendar events alongside FlowState tasks in the Calendar view.

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Google OAuth must include `calendar.readonly` scope (extends FEATURE-1202)
- [ ] Settings UI: "Connect Google Calendar" toggle in Settings > Integrations
- [ ] Fetch events from Google Calendar API (read-only)
- [ ] Display events in Calendar view with distinct styling (differentiate from tasks)
- [ ] Handle token refresh for long-lived sessions
- [ ] Graceful degradation when offline or token expired

**Key Decisions Needed**:
- Read-only vs read-write (create FlowState tasks from calendar events?)
- Which calendars to sync (primary only vs user-selectable)
- Event display style (overlay, side-by-side, merged timeline)

### TASK-1284: Add Quick Task Creation to KDE Plasma Widget (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P0 | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS | **Repo**: `pomoflow-kde` (separate)

**Feature**: Add a quick-capture text field to the pomoflow-kde Plasma panel widget so users can create tasks directly from the desktop without opening FlowState. Tasks land in the Inbox.

**Architecture**:
- Single `PlasmaComponents3.TextField` + submit button in widget panel
- POST to Supabase REST API (`/rest/v1/tasks`) with JWT auth (reuse existing timer auth)
- Minimum payload: `{ user_id, title, status: "planned", is_in_inbox: true }`
- Task appears in FlowState Inbox via Realtime subscription

**Phases**:
- [ ] **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Text field + Enter-to-submit, creates task with title only
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Priority dropdown (Low/Med/High)
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Project selector (fetch projects list)
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Recent tasks list in expanded widget view

**Key Decisions**:
- Auth: Reuse existing timer sync token mechanism
- No offline queue needed — just show error on failure
- Let DB auto-generate UUIDs (don't send `id` in payload)

### TASK-1292: Quick Task Creation in KDE Widget (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P0 | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW (2026-02-10) | **Repo**: `pomoflow-kde` (separate)

**Feature**: Enhanced quick-capture functionality for the KDE Plasma widget with task creation and pinned task shortcuts.

**Implementation**:
1. **Quick-add input row** with two buttons:
   - "+" button: Create task only (lands in Inbox)
   - Play button: Create task + start timer immediately
2. **Pinned tasks** as teal-bordered chip shortcuts below input:
   - Tap chip: Find existing task by title OR create if doesn't exist + start timer
   - Data persists via `pinned_tasks` table on VPS
3. **Pin button** (📌) in task list delegate for quick pinning
4. **Data sync**:
   - `fetchPinnedTasks()` called on auth success, token refresh, and Refresh button
   - Uses existing Supabase REST API (`/rest/v1/pinned_tasks`)

**Architecture**:
- Leverages existing Supabase auth (JWT token from timer sync)
- POST to `/rest/v1/tasks` with `{ user_id, title, status: "planned", is_in_inbox: true }`
- Task creation reuses pattern from TASK-1284 Phase 1
- Pinned tasks query: `GET /rest/v1/pinned_tasks?user_id=eq.{uuid}&select=*&order=created_at.desc`

**Files**: `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.pomoflow.widget/contents/ui/main.qml`

**Progress (2026-02-10):** All features implemented. Quick-add input with create/play buttons functional. Pinned tasks chips display and trigger task find/create + timer start. Pin button in task list delegate works. Awaiting user testing.

### FEATURE-1293: Catalog View UX/UI Redesign (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P2 | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Problem**: The Catalog view (AllTasksView) has poor UX/UI — broken table header layout, no visual hierarchy in list mode, generic feel compared to Canvas and Cyberflow views. Neither Table nor List mode is usable for the owner's workflow.

**Goal**: Redesign to support 4 use cases: bulk operations, quick scanning, inline data management, and review/triage. Keep glass morphism aesthetic, execute it better.

**Files**: `src/views/AllTasksView.vue`, `src/components/tasks/TaskTable.vue`, `src/components/tasks/TaskList.vue`, `src/components/layout/ViewControls.vue`

**Research Completed (2026-02-10)**:
- 4-agent investigation: keep-advocate, archive-advocate, codebase-analyst, industry-trends
- Decision: Redesign, not archive. Canvas is the core differentiator; Catalog view should complement it for data-heavy tasks
- User requirements: bulk ops, quick scanning, inline editing, review/triage
- Design direction: Glass morphism (current theme) executed well

**Progress (2026-02-10):** Research phase complete — 4 agents investigated archive-vs-redesign from different perspectives. Decision made to redesign with glass morphism aesthetic. Planning phase next.

### BUG-1131: Move All Exposed API Keys to Backend Proxy (📋 PLANNED)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 📋 PLANNED

**Problem**: API keys with `VITE_*` prefix are bundled into client JavaScript by Vite, making them visible to anyone who inspects the bundle:
- `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY` - Groq Whisper for voice transcription
- `VITE_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` - DeepSeek AI chat
- `VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Anthropic Claude API
- `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API

**Root Cause**: Using `import.meta.env.VITE_*` to access API keys. Even when stored in Doppler, the VITE_ prefix causes client bundling.

**Solution**: Create Supabase Edge Functions as backend proxies:
1. Create `supabase/functions/ai-proxy/` for all AI API calls
2. Move API keys to Supabase Edge Function secrets (not VITE_ prefixed)
3. Update frontend services to call Edge Functions instead of direct API calls

### ~~FEATURE-1194~~: Tauri In-App Auto-Updater via VPS (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-06)

**Feature**: "Update App" button inside FlowState that checks VPS for newer builds, downloads, and installs them automatically - no terminal or `dpkg -i` needed.

**Architecture**:
1. **VPS endpoint** (`in-theflow.com/updates/`) - Caddy serves update manifest JSON + AppImage binaries
2. **Tauri updater plugin** (`@tauri-apps/plugin-updater@2.10.0`) - built-in self-update mechanism
3. **CI/CD pipeline** - GitHub Actions builds multi-platform Tauri binaries on push/tag, rsyncs to VPS
4. **App UI** - "Check for Updates" button in Settings, notification on app launch when update available
5. **AppImage ONLY** - .deb installs cannot self-update (Tauri limitation). User runs AppImage from `~/Applications/`

**Implementation Steps**:
- [x] Configure `@tauri-apps/plugin-updater` in `tauri.conf.json` with VPS update endpoint
- [x] Set up VPS directory structure (`/var/www/flowstate/updates/`) with Caddy serving
- [x] Create update manifest generation script (`scripts/generate-update-manifest.cjs`)
- [x] Modify GitHub Actions release workflow to build + upload binaries to VPS
- [x] Code-signing configured (signing keys + pubkey, password in KWallet)
- [x] Add "Check for Updates" UI in Settings > About tab
- [x] Auto-check on app launch with non-intrusive notification (existing `TauriUpdateNotification.vue`)
- [x] Automated deploy script (`scripts/deploy-tauri-update.sh`)
- [x] Fix `createUpdaterArtifacts` from "v1Compatible" to `true` (v2 format)
- [x] Fix manifest generator to filter by current version (was picking up old artifacts)
- [x] Bump tauri crate to 2.10, plugin-updater to 2.10.0
- [x] Test full update cycle: build → upload → detect → download → install → restart ✅ VERIFIED

**Completed (2026-02-06):** Full E2E update cycle verified: v1.2.15 AppImage detected v1.2.16 on VPS, downloaded, installed, and restarted successfully. Key fixes: switched to v2 artifact format, fixed manifest generator version filtering, regenerated signing keys, updated all documentation.

**Key Files**:
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Updater plugin config (endpoint: `in-theflow.com/updates/latest.json`)
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - CI/CD for multi-platform builds + VPS deploy
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Modified to exclude `/updates/` from rsync delete
- `scripts/generate-update-manifest.cjs` - Generates `latest.json` from build artifacts
- `scripts/tauri-build-signed.sh` - Build script with signing key loading
- `scripts/tauri-upload-update.sh` - Upload artifacts to VPS

### TASK-1287: Cyberflow RPG — Full Cyberpunk Game UI Overhaul (🔄 IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: P2-MEDIUM | **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (2026-02-07)

**Parent**: FEATURE-1118

**Goal**: Complete cyberpunk visual overhaul of the gamification system with dedicated Cyberflow command center, Anti-Chore game design, and system interconnections.

**Phase 1: Visual Foundation** ✅
- Installed augmented-ui, added cyberpunk fonts (Rajdhani, Orbitron, Space Mono)
- Created `src/assets/cyberflow-tokens.css` (neon palette, glow effects, clip-paths, animations)
- Created `src/composables/useCyberflowTheme.ts` (intensity-aware theme composable)

**Phase 2: Cyberflow Hub Page** ✅
- New `/cyberflow` route with 5-tab navigation (Overview/Missions/Boss/Upgrades/Trophies)
- Created 12 new cyber components (CyberDashboardHub, CyberMissionBriefing, CyberBossFight, CyberCharacterProfile, CyberSkillTree, CyberAchievements, CyberShop, etc.)
- Hub-and-spoke layout: Overview cards → drill into tabs

**Phase 3: Header Widget Redesign + Intensity Levels** ✅
- Restyled LevelBadge, XpBar, StreakCounter with cyberpunk aesthetics
- Intensity filtering wired up (minimal/moderate/intense)
- Exposure toast system (shielded/exposed) with proper icon rendering

**Phase P0: Anti-Chore Game Mechanics** ✅
- Created `docs/game-mechanics.md` — authoritative game design reference
- Removed exposed penalty (timer = invitation, not obligation)
- Removed XP decay (earned XP permanent forever)
- Updated SHIELDED_XP_BONUS from 1.10 to 1.15
- Suppressed nagging "EXPOSED" toast per Distraction Test

**Progress (2026-02-08):** Phases 1-3 complete + P0 anti-chore constants applied. 624 tests passing, zero TS errors. Next: P1 items (streak multiplier, corruption XP modifier, partial boss credit).

### ~~BUG-1293~~: Canvas CSS Tokenization Damage (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1 | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-09)

TASK-1223 tokenization commit introduced broken CSS in TaskNode.vue and GroupNodeSimple.vue:
- `var(--shadow-md)` (full shorthand) used as color in compound box-shadows → all shadows invalid
- Phantom tokens (`--color-danger-soft`, `--color-orange-soft`, `--color-blue-soft`, `--overlay-backdrop`, `--color-purple-soft`) never added to design-tokens.css
- GroupNodeSimple background swapped to opaque `--surface-elevated` instead of semi-transparent
- Debug span and watcher left in GroupNodeSimple template/script

**Fix**: Replaced all broken token references with inline rgba values. Removed debug elements.

### BUG-1291: Timer & Context Menu Broken Across Views (👀 REVIEW)

**Priority**: P0-CRITICAL | **Status**: 👀 REVIEW

**Symptoms** (4 bugs, likely shared root causes):
1. **Calendar play button**: Pressing play icon on a calendar task doesn't start the timer
2. **Context menu "Start" button**: Creates calendar instance (moves task) but timer doesn't start
3. **Calendar right-click**: No context menu appears when right-clicking a calendar task
4. **Canvas play button**: Pressing play on canvas doesn't reliably start timer in calendar

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Timer bugs (1, 2, 4): `timerStore.startTimer()` fails silently — likely `clearExistingSession()` async failure or error in `startTaskNowWithUndo()` preventing timer from being called
- Context menu bug (3): Global `task-context-menu` event dispatch exists and ModalManager listens, but event may not reach handler or task lookup may fail silently

**Progress (2026-02-10):** All 4 symptoms addressed:
1. ✅ Calendar play button — fixed timer.ts leadership claim silent abort; calendar timer integration reuses completed instances with cumulative time tracking
2. ✅ Context menu "Start" — fixed timezone mismatch in guard (UTC vs local); fixed `startTaskNow` appending instances instead of replacing; split into independent try blocks
3. ✅ Calendar right-click — fixed `handleEventContextMenu` using `taskStore.tasks` (filtered) instead of `getTask()` (raw). Tasks not in active filter were silently not found.
4. ✅ Canvas play button — same timer.ts leadership fix applies; canvas uses context menu "Start"/"Timer" which flows through the same fixed paths

Awaiting user testing to confirm all 4 symptoms resolved.

**Files**:
- `src/composables/calendar/useCalendarTimerIntegration.ts` — Calendar play button handler
- `src/composables/tasks/useTaskContextMenuActions.ts` — "Start" and "Timer" context menu actions
- `src/composables/calendar/useCalendarInteractionHandlers.ts` — Right-click event dispatch
- `src/stores/timer.ts` — `startTimer()` with `clearExistingSession` + `claimTimerLeadership`
- `src/layouts/ModalManager.vue` — Global task context menu handler

### ~~BUG-1292~~: KDE Widget Intermittently Fails to Start Break Timer (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-10)

**Root Cause**: When a work session completes, `onSessionComplete()` sets `hasActiveSession = false`, causing `syncTimer.interval` to switch from 2s to 30s polling. User clicks "Break" in notification → `notify.sh` POSTs new session to Supabase → widget won't discover it for up to 30 seconds.

**Fix**: 6 targeted edits:
1. Added `transitionUntil` property (timestamp-based 15s grace period)
2. **Main fix**: `syncTimer.interval` now checks `sessionJustCompleted || Date.now() < transitionUntil`
3. Grace period set in `onSessionComplete()` — 15s fast-poll window
4. Empty-result guard during transition prevents UI flicker
5. Error handling for non-200/non-401 responses in `fetchCurrentSession()`
6. `notify.sh` now retries (2x with 1s delay) and logs to `/tmp/pomoflow-notify.log`

**Files**:
- `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.pomoflow.widget/contents/ui/main.qml`
- `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.pomoflow.widget/contents/scripts/notify.sh`

### ~~BUG-1294~~: Calendar Play Button Shouldn't Reset Timer for Already-Running Task (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-10)

**Problem**: Calendar play button would reset the timer or create duplicate timer instances when clicked on a task that already has a timer running.

**Root Cause**: Calendar play button handler (`useCalendarTimerIntegration.ts`) didn't check if timer was already running for the clicked task. Combined with TASK-1287's same-task no-op guard being incomplete, this allowed timer resets.

**Fix**: 2-file change:
1. **src/stores/timer.ts** — Expanded TASK-1287 guard to be a true no-op when timer is already running for the same task (early return before any state changes)
2. **src/composables/calendar/useCalendarTimerIntegration.ts** — Added early return in calendar play handler when timer is already running for the clicked task

**Files**:
- `src/stores/timer.ts`
- `src/composables/calendar/useCalendarTimerIntegration.ts`

### ~~BUG-1296~~: Time Block Notifications Never Fire (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-10)

**Problem**: `useTimeBlockNotifications.ts` accessed `taskStore._rawTasks` (private internal ref) instead of `taskStore.rawTasks` (public computed). This returned `undefined`, so the `Array.isArray()` fallback always produced `[]` — zero blocks found, zero notifications fired.

**Root Cause**: Property name mismatch. `_rawTasks` is an internal `ref` inside `useTaskStates()`. The store exposes it publicly as `rawTasks` via a computed.

**Fix**: Changed all 3 occurrences of `taskStore._rawTasks` → `taskStore.rawTasks` in `useTimeBlockNotifications.ts` (lines 71, 286, 355).

**Files**:
- `src/composables/useTimeBlockNotifications.ts`

### ~~TASK-1288~~: Tauri Crash Stability Fixes (✅ DONE)

**Priority**: P1-HIGH | **Status**: ✅ DONE (2026-02-08)

**Problem**: Tauri desktop app crashed on close and during sync due to multiple issues: unhandled promise rejections, sync intervals firing after teardown, notification floods, and missing Rust panic recovery.

**Fixes Applied (7 files)**:
1. `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` — Set `panic=unwind` in release profile for graceful panic recovery
2. `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` — Added release-mode logging for crash diagnostics
3. `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` — Added `http:default` permission for curl/fetch
4. `src/utils/errorHandler.ts` — Added notification throttling (max 3 per 10s) to prevent toast floods
5. `src/main.ts` — Removed duplicate `unhandledrejection` handler (was conflicting with errorHandler)
6. `src/composables/useTauriStartup.ts` — Added 5s timeout to close handler to prevent hang-on-exit
7. `src/composables/sync/useSyncOrchestrator.ts` — Added interval ID guard to prevent sync after teardown

**Deployed**: v1.2.36 via `deploy-tauri-update.sh`

## Architecture Constraints

- **Geometry write policy**: Only drag handlers + explicit move actions may change `parentId`, `canvasPosition`, `parentGroupId`, `position`
- **Sync is read-only**: `syncStoreToCanvas` does NOT write to stores
- **Smart Groups metadata-only**: May update `dueDate`/`status`/`priority`, never geometry
