## Processed Ideas / Issues
- [x] Brain dump section in the canvas inbox doesnt support rtl and hebrew and english mix correctly like the rest of the app and it needs to be implemented well
- [x] new icon for the web app - the main logo and the tauri app icon and favicon - it needs to be a cyber tomato or something like that - clean minimal, cyberpunky but still the same concept
- [x]make sure that the tauri app design mimics 1 to 1 the web app design
