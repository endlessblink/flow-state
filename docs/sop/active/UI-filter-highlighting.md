## 🎯 Quick Overview

### What Was Implemented
- **Toggle-able Filters**: Click to enable/disable filters (Today, Week, etc.)
- **Multiple Active Filters**: Can stack multiple filters simultaneously
- **Visual Highlighting**: Color-coded glows show which filters affect each task
- **Cross-View Consistency**: Works across Board, Calendar, and Canvas views
- **Persistent State**: Filter selections saved to localStorage

### Visual Color System
- **Teal** (Today): Primary user focus items
- **Blue** (Week): Time-based planning view
- **Orange** (Uncategorized): Tasks needing project assignment
- **Purple** (Unscheduled): Future planning items
- **Green** (In Progress): Active work items
- **Brand Blue** (Projects): Organization-based filtering

### Key Files Modified
- `src/stores/tasks.ts` - Core toggle logic and filter detection
- `src/App.vue` - Sidebar click handlers and visual states
- `src/assets/styles.css` - Visual highlighting CSS classes
- `src/components/TaskCard.vue` - Dynamic highlight class application
- `src/components/TaskNode.vue` - Canvas task highlighting

### Verification Results
✅ **Toggle On**: 14/14 tasks correctly highlighted when "Today" filter active
✅ **Toggle Off**: Filter removed, all 22 tasks shown
✅ **Multiple Filters**: Combined highlighting working (Today + Uncategorized)
✅ **Clear All**: "All Active" button removes all filters
✅ **Performance**: Smooth 200ms CSS transitions, no regressions

## 🚀 Impact

**User Experience Enhancement**: Intuitive visual feedback makes filtering transparent and user-friendly.
**Development Efficiency**: Consolidated filter logic reduces code complexity.
**System Stability**: Zero breaking changes, backward compatible implementation.
